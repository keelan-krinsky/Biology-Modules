# Fungal Taxonomy 

## Phyla 

## Acoso

## Fungal cell strucvture
Some species are dimorphic, they can grow as unicellular yeast or as multicelluar filamentous structures.

### Unicellular 
yeast

### Filametious 
multicellular

## Fungi Cell Structure
Can be multinucleate

### Apex 
Polerised, cell polerisationand the location ofthe spitzenkper are used in conjuctionto determine the dirrection of growth. 

### Spitzenkorper
Small structure near the apex required for rapid hyphal extension (studines invovling delteed genes for the structure lead to much lower growth rates). The structre is not required for hyphal polerisation. Acts as the vesicle supply center, exocytotic vesicles bud out from the spitzenkoper. Exocytotic vesicles also bind to the spitzenkorper and to merge with the cell membrane, all membrane are derrived from the golgi, ( the cellular organisation anddistribution center of the cell).  

## Fungal Growth

### Filamentious fungi
grow by hyphal extentioin wich is foward growth from the tip of the hyphae, this is a continuous prcoess which is not linked to nuclear division. 

#### Models 

##### Ameboid model
Extends in a similar fashion to the ameboid moviment. 

##### Steady state model 
Chitin in the tip has not yet formed strong bonds so is flexible, which allows for growth. 


##### Vesicle supply center (preffered model)
The hyphae contain a structure at the tip which regulates the vesicle supply. 

##### COmbination
The hyphal tip/apex grows forward. 

Enzymes packaged into vesicles are taked\n to the spintzencouper such as chitin synthase 3, which is required for cell wall growth.  

Exocytosis
added membrane+protein to cell wall + enzymes secreted. (the majority of reabsorbed enzymes are sent back to the tip,fro where they may be sent to protein degradation or dirrectly reused).

##### Endocytosis 
As growth is energy expensive to conserve energy enzymes are recycled,as hyphae move foward enzymes excreted are now relatively furtherback on the hyphage, they endocytose back into the cell and are recycled.

Golgi

> NOTE: golgi in fungi are called gogi equivalents. 

pivotal role in vesicle trafficking 
source of exocyitic vesicles, and journey for some endosomes. Localised to the hyphal apex actin/cytoskeleton dependant process. golgi is responsible for polerisationandare essential for hyphal growth. 

Turger pressure
hydrostatic pressure of membrane against cell wall. Turger pressure is usedto penetrate barriers, both for the purpose of more effecient nutrient digestion (increased surface area touching food), and for pathogenesis, especially of dimorphic fungi.

## Dimorphic fungi
Most are thermodimorphic, i.e they have temperature induced shifts, normally switching from filamentous formin the cold to filamentous at high temperatures. Some switch the otherway round. The morphology shift can also be induced by albumen, pH nutrients, hypoxia, $CO_2$ and N-glycosyl amine. 


The cytoskeleton boundtothe cellwallpullsthe spitzenkoper foward as the cell grows. 

## Hyphal penetration
_Canadida albicans_ Dimorphic fungi, leaves in humans as commensal yeast, shift in the envirnoment (such as HIV infection), causes $Canidida$ to pernetrate cells either by endocytosis, or hyphalpentration using turgor pressure. 

### Hyphal initiation.

requires asymmetry / polerisation 
triggered by G1 cyclin (Ccn1), essentail for transition between yeastand filamentous growth. it starts to persist and accumulate longer, polerised to one side of the cell. 

Hyphal maintenance 
increased activationof GTP ase Cdc42
Rho GTPases are celtral to dynamic cytoskeletal assembly and rearrangment leadingto decreased expression of RAM proteins (supressing separation). 


## Hyphal branching
associcated with de nova formation of the spitzenkorper. 

there are two modes for branching, oneis associated with septa. random branching also occurs, and branching inmycorrhizae is strongly influenced by external factors, ie infleunce of the plant. 

## Fungi Reproduction 
Meosis 

### Sexual spores
three types

### Basidiomycota

#### Mushrooms

#### Rusts Smuts

#### Life cycle

 basiodiospores, germinate and start to produce fungi, bypolerisation/hyphal initail mantenance and extension. Basidiospores are haploid, grow into hyphae and meet with opposite mating types (in bipolar organsism, some are tetrapolar that is four mating types). mating types can be +/- .
 plasmogamy occurs, ie fussion of the cytoplasm, hyphae can grow in this strate for over a decade, finally a fruiting body forms, from the dikaryotic hyphae. Eventaully caryogamy occurs in which the nuclei fuse. then spores are formed and release (the stalk and bellof the muschroom are still dicharyotic, only the spoers at the tip  )

 ## Bipolar mating system 
 all the genes required for mating are located close together on the gemone in the mating locus (similar to a bacterial operon). a pherhorme is required and a pherhormne receptor. Pherhomoe precursors are also involved. COPY IMAGE. precursurand receptor genes are grouped together with the homdomain protein. 
mating type A (MF=mating perhormoes).

black flanking genes red genes within the anceint stratum , blue in the intermediate stratum receptor proteins and mating genes are conserved. dont mutate fast sa they require. Not very well conserved between species, differnt species will not mate with eachother (with some exteptions such as crypto coccus ). One or both strains may roduce pherhormes usually due to nutrient differcinecy such as nitrogen. 

MATa produces a pheromone MFa in response to environmental stimuli, such as nitrogen starvation and dessication.

MFa binds to its cognate receptors on MAT$\alpha$ and a conjugation tubethat fuses with MATa in plasmogamy. COPY images. mata congugation tube forms andthe two cells fuse together. mat has pherhorme receptors for $\alpha$ receptors and visa versa. Mat$\alpha$ will replicate its nucleus first, mat $\alpha$ always moves into the mata cell, mat a then duplcates its nucleus the nely formed cell becomes polerised and hyphal formation occurs, one of the Mat$\alpha$ moves inro the hyphal extension, however only the mitochondrial from the mata are confered to the new structre. dicharyotic mycellium will then continue to grow. 

to ensure the speta formation keeps oneof eachnuclei in each division, the cytoskeleton pullsthe nucleito the apex unti they undergo replication at which point a clamp connect (a lateral branch) will form going back to the cell behindin one of each nuclei will migrate back into the previous cell. 

> NOTE: clamp connections never decay, the argumentis that the cytoskeleton remains fixed so the nuceli dont move so cant migrate back. 

## Spore Dispersal 
wind, water animals, 
attract with bioluminesence, smell color,


 >NOTE: pherhormes are proteins.
