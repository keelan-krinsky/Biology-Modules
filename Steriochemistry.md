## Rotamers

Isomers which can be interconverted by rotation (of a given part of the molecule)  about a particular bond

Different isomers are known as Isoforms.

NOTE: bonds within molecules can lengthed, shorted,bend and rotate, depending on what stresses are excerted upon them.

### Newman Projections
A visualisation of a moleculeviewed from the front.

  the front atom is reprisented as a dot
  the back atom is reprisented as a circle.

### Conformations

#### Staggered
Surrounding atoms/hydrogens are all equally spaced.

this conformation is more stable for two reasons

##### Steric Hinderance
in the eclipsed conformation outside atoms are forced to close to eachother, raising the energy level of the conformation

##### Hyperconjugation
stabilising interactions of the electrons in a $\sigma$-bond (usually C-H or C-C) with an adjacent empty or partially filled p-orbital or a $pi$-orbital to give an extended molecular orbital that increases the stability of the system)

#### Eclipsed
Outside atoms line up with each other.

#### Dihedral Angle

There is a whole range of conformations depending on the exact angle of rotation.
1. anti (180 orinetation)
2. gauche (60 orientation)

##### Protiens
protiens also exibit a dihedral structure with peptide bods forming planes whith a given angle between them

![Proteins Dihedral Angle](Images/DihedralAngle.jpg)

this angle can be calculated which is very useful as most protein analysing techniques are very low res (for example obsorbance spectra to distinguish protein (max absorbance 280nm) from DNA/RNA (max absorbance 260nm)
)

###### Solving protein structure
1. complex maths in necessary (furner(?) transfer analysis)
2. complex measuring equipment is needed.

## Inantomers.

### Enantiomers
opposite conformation at all chiral centers.

#### Chiral compounds
a chiral compound consists of four separate atoms bonded to one central (tetrahedral,carbon) molecule.

NOTE: this central carbon atom will always be $sp^{3}$ hybridized.

##### Optical activity
certain molecules rotate plane polerised light to the right (dextrorotatory + ) or to the left (levorotatory - )

the exact degree of rotation depends on the length of substance which the light is shon through, the composition of the substance, and the optical properties of the substance.

###### Poleriser
only allows light of certain phases (that is light with a particular electric and magnetic component) through. the light alowed throguh is now plane polerised.

###### Analyser
observes/ analyses how light interacts with certain molecules.


### Diastereomers
opposite conformation at some chiral centers.

#### Allo Diastereomers

#### Messo Diastereomers
2S3R mirror image is 2R3S,
also possilbe to be identical but rotated by 180 degrees.

### Drawing structures

#### simple system
1. wedges indicate bonds coming out of the page
2. straight lines are in the line of the page.
3. dotted line are receding back out of the page.

#### Fisher Convention.
2 dimentional reprisentation of a three dimentional molecule.

The stereocentre furthest from the anomeric centre. The rotation brings about two distinct configurations, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ â€“ anomers)
1. For sugars if the OH group is on the right it is a D sugar.
2. If it is on the left then it is an L sugar.
3. vertical lines reprisent atoms thatpoint away from the viewer.
4. horizontal lines reprisent atoms that point towards the viewer.
5. the point of intersection between thevertical and horizontal lines reprisents the centeral carbo atom.


NOTE: the anomernic carbon is the carbon single bonded to two oxygen molecules.

##### Amino Acids
NOTE: natural Amino Acids occur in the L form only.

NOTE: appart from glycine all amino acids are chiral.

###### D and L convention  
L amino acids have the $H_3N^{+}$ group on the left side, D antomers have it on the right side.

###### CORN.
along the line between th COO and N group, if R is left of the central Carbon atom the antomer is L, if R is right the antomer is D.

Alternative
if the molecule is orinetated with the H group dirrectly behind the centeral carbon. then if CoRN reads clockwise the antomer is a D amino acid, if it reads Anticlockwise it is an L amino acid.

###### R and S (find what R and S stand for)

more generally applicable

each atom around the central carbon is assigned a priority based on its atomic number (lower atomic number $\rightarrow$) lower priority. (if two atoms have equal atomic numbers then the atomic numbers of their side groups are checked and so on outwards until an order can be established)

###### Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Convention
Uses the R, S system but is still based on glyceraldehyde.
1. priorities are assigned
2. the molecule is orientated so that the lowest priority group is dirrectly behinf the central carbon atom.
3. if the remain molecules arrange clockwise in terms of priority (highest to lowers) the molecule is a R antomer, if they arrange counterclockwise the molecule is a S antomer

NOTE: D sugars have the R conformation and L sugars have the S conformation.

#### Racemates
rotate light equally in both dirrections with no net effect, usually made up of equal concnetrations of opposite chiral molecules.

#### chirality in nature
usually only one isomer is present due to enzymatic selection

#### chirality in drug design
It is vitally important that the right isomer is used.

##### examples
1. Prozac (S prevents migraine, R does nothing)
2. thyidol (?), both effective to supress morning sickness but wrong insomer can lead to birth defects.

#### Prochirality
A molecule is said to be prochiral if it can convert from achiral to chiral in a single chemical step. (such as the addition of a group to a planar $sp^2$ hybridized molecule, or by the substitution into a tetrahedral molecule.

##### Face
the dirrection/ orientation in which a molecule binds. )
Face is related to the need to assign prioritory values to differentiate between identical groups in a prochiral molecule. this identification and the idea of face is imprtant because enzymes will favour which one of the identical groups to act upon depending on its orientation with respect to the rest of the molecule (its face)
