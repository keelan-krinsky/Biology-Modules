## Background
Metabolism is governed by a relatively small set of relatively simple rules. 

### Principles of chemical kinetics.
$A\rightarrow B$ \newline 
assume spontaneous and irreversible. 

rate defined in terms of change in concentration of the reactants or products. 

NOTE: Copy notes from chemical kinetics. 

$v=-\frac{d[A]}{dt}=\frac{d[P]}{dt}$ the infinitesimal rate. 

### Rate Law.
$v=\text{k}[A]$ where k is the rate constant. 
reverse rate $k^{-1}[P]$\newline 

$V\propto [A]$ \newline 
k is the rate constant of the constant of proportionality.



# Metabolism
metabolsim is the sum of the chemical changes which convert nutrinets (substrate in to enrgy and products via specific chemcial intermediates. Metabolism is organised into a number of discrete pathways. 

The relatively universal metabolic pathways as well as those more more specific to a particular, many pathways are ancient startign off billions of years ago, for example glycolysis which started off when the earthe way still anerobic. changes are more based on how the pathways are regulated, and number of intermediaries. 
theere is a basic set of metabolic pathways common to most organisms. different cells and organisms may express alternative pathways, diversity to metabolic processes. 

NB: lots of evidence in essays. 

organisms are classified by how they obtain their carbon and energy. different organisms classified in different ways will have different metabolic pathways, eg photosynthesis in autotrophes. 

photoautotrophic cells synthesize energy from the sun to porduce glucose and oxygen. the reactants are water and carbon dioxide the products are glocuse and oxygen. The heterotrophes use the glucose as fuele and building blocks to synthesie their own biomolecules. (plants can also use heterotrohic pathways.). In this way a cycle is set up. 

the process of metabolsim involves the genration of energy and the synthesis of biomolecules

### Anabolism
building/synthesis. Energy optained from catabolic processes is used to drive anabolic reaction sto syntheise biological molecules. 
,anabolsim is enthalpically favoured but entropically opposed. 
diverges to a wide variety of biomacromolecules. 


### Catabolsim
breaking down. catabolism is used to generate energy to drive biosynthesis, an anabolic process. Catabolism is endothermic but entropically favoured. Normally an oxidative process. Catabolism is the breakdown of complex nutrients (carbohydrates lipids and proteins), into smaller substituents such as lactic acid carbon dioxide, urea ammonia nad ethanol. excergonic. oxidative, (high energy electrons are removed from the substrate). to electron carriers, such as $NAD^+$, $NADP^+$ and FAD, co-enzymes. which are reduced to $NADH$ $NADPH$ and $FAD_2$. these conenzymes can then be used in the reductive biosyntheis reactions of anabliism. this energy producing process is required for oxidative processes. reduced coenzymess are oxidised to release energy. (this energy is required to build up large molecules. )
converges to common intermediates

#### Stage 1
large completx molecules into their building bocks. 

# . Carbohydrate biuld from monosacherides.
 
### Lipids.
fatty acids and glycerol 

 ### proteins 
amino acids.

NOTE: the synthesis of a molecule takes more energy than the break down provides, (as energy is lost in unusable forms such as heat)
 
## Ordering
catabolsim and metabolism cannot be left to occur at the same time without tight control. metabolic needs are served in an immediate and orderly fashion. competing metabolic pathways localised in different cellular compartments, to avoid any interferance. (copy example). 
The intermediates are spacially and chemcically segrigated. the competing pathways are isolated from eachother. 

A pathway cannot go backways and forways, for one becasue the would be no way of regulating it, the points of regulation are the points at which the eqillirium is shifted very strongly in one dirrection


### Glycolysis
Anabolic synthesis of a given end porduct does not correspont to the catabolci pathway of the same substrate en catbolsim of glucose to pyruvate vs biosynthesis of glucose from pyruvate, there are 10 enzymes in glycolysis nad only seven of the ten are act in reverse in gluconeogenesis, 4 new enzymes are also active. 
The regulation of catablosim and anbolsim are separate, as they have different regulation points, this is achieved, either by the pathwwys following completely different steps, or only one or a few enzymes are used for a specific step (much of the pathway is shared) the enzymes which are different are the regulatory pathways, theses points have the highest $\Delta G$. 

## The ATP cycle
Copy imgae. 

## Reuced coenzyme cycles.
(oxidative reactions release hydride ions $H^-$) which is how electrons are transferred. the hydride ions are tranferred to the oxidised form of the coenzymes to reduce them $NAD^+\rightarrow NADH$. NADH is oxidised to AND^+ during anabolsim and finally the electon acceptro oxygen which when it is reduced becomes water. 
the additional H adds to the nictotinamine portion of the molecule. 

### NAD(P)H cycle.


COPY IMAGE. 

#### Stage 2
amino acids to alpha keto acids, and then pyruvate or acetylp co A 
glycerol and glucose to pyruvate. and fatty acids to acetyl CoA. 
pyruvate can be further brocked down into acetyl-coA (the common end product of metabolism

final waste products are carbon dioxide and water. )

 ## amphibolism. 
does both. 



># Glycolysis
>Glycolysis is the stepwise degradation of glucose
>
>## Background
>Glycolysis is a very ancient process, which arose relatively early on in evolutionary history, and as a result today almost all living organisms undergo some form of glycolysis. Glycolysis is also anaerobic, as it arose before oxygen formed a large substituent of the earths atmosphere. In Aerobic organism glycolysis remains anaerobic although the products of glycolysis are fed into the aerobic pathways. 
>
>## Process
>Glycolysis involves the break down of 1 glucose molecule into two pyruvate molecules, ($6C \rightarrow 3C$), via ten enzymes catalysed steps. 
>
>### Phase #1 (Priming)
>Glucose is converted into the right form for energy to be release from it. 
>(Glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate is produced by the splitting of glucose.)
>
>#### Energy requirements
>2 ATP molecules are used in this process. 
>
>### Phase #2
>Glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate is converted to pyruvate. 
>
>### Reaction #1
>Glucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase or glucokinase, which require magnesium to function). This reaction constitutes the first priming reaction and requires an ATP molecule to proceed. 
>
>#### Equation
>$Glucose + ATP \riightarrow glucose-6-phosphare + ADP + H^+$  $\quad \quad $ $\Delta G^\circ  = -16.7 kJ\cdot ml^{-1}$
>
>#### Enzymes
>Glucokinase only functions at high glucose levels whereas hexokinase binds glucose at low glucose concentrations,hence glucokinase is only active after a high glucose meal. Extracellular glucose will move into the cell as glucose is converted from glucose to glucose 6 phosphate, by the law of mass action. 
>
>#### Regulation.
>Hexoinkase is one of the regulated enzymes in glycolysis (high negative $\Delta G$)
>
>The reaction is not thermodynaically favorable without coupling with ATP. 
>
>### Reaction #2
>Phosphoglucoisomerase (Mg catalyses the isomerisation of glucose-6-phosphate). 
>
>### Reaction #3
>Second priing reaction requires ATP, phosphofructokinase (Mg) adds a second phosphrylation. 
>
>### Reaction #4
>Fructose biphosphate aldose, producs two 3 carbo intermediate. 
>
>### Reaction #5
>Triose phosphare isomerase compelets the first phase of glycolysis by catalysing an ismoerisation reaction. 
>
>### Phase 2
>### Reaction #6
>Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase produces a high energy intermediate in an oxidation reaction. 
>
>### reaction #7
>
>#### Spontaneity
>Very spontaneous coupling with reaction six, drives reaction six
>
>#### Reaction
>$1,3-BPG+ADP \rightarrow 3 phosphoglycerate+ATP$ $\Delta G^\circ ' -18.9kJ.mol^{-1}$ 
>
>#### Enzyme
>Phosphoglycerate Kinase
>
>#### Cofactors
>#### ATP Production
>regenerates ATP used earlier in Glycolysis. 
>
>Phosphoglycerate kinase ($Mg^{2+}$) as in the back reaction the phosphoglycerate is phosphorylated. or it could be called 1,3-Bisphosphate phosphatase. 
>
>this reaction has a large negative $\Delta G$ and hence is a site of regulation. 
>
>first substrate level phosphrylation occurs, ie the phosphate group derrives dirrectly from the phosphate, in the ETC ATP is formed from ATP by substrate level phosphorylation.

>### Reaction #10
>
>#### Enzyme
>pyruvate kinase (phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase)
>
>transfer of a phosphoryl group from PEP to ADP to generate ATP and Pyruvate, enol tautomer converted to more favourable keto tautomer, 
>
>tautomers are isomers which can readily intraconvert between each other. 
>
>#### Reaction

>
>## Biological significance
>Glycolysis is a particularly important process as in many cases glucose is the only source of metabolic energy. Cells of the brain kidney contractual skeletal muscles, erythrocytes, and sperm cell, are all solely reliant on glycolysis for energy. 
>
>## Products
>Pyruvate is a versatile metabolite, depending on the availability of oxygen, pyruvate can undergo further oxidation to form acetyl-CoA and carbon dioxide. If oxygen is not present then in animal cells the pyruvate will be converted to lactic acid (lactate), and in yeast cells it will undergo alcoholic fermentation to form ethanol.

## Alcoholic Fermentation

fermetation: production of energy by reaction pathsways involving redox where e- acceptors are organic molecules. 

In the absence of oxygen reaction 6 cannot occur if there is no $NAD^+$ the recycling of $NAD^+$ via the reduction of pyruvate. 

### Step 1 decarbaoxylation
decarboxylation, from 3C to 2C, releasing carbon dioxide in the process. 

### Step 2 reduction
acid alde3hyde is reduced to form ethanol, and regenerate NAD^+, the end product of the process is ethanol. 

### Lactic acid fermentation.

occurs in the muscles and the cornea of the eye. too much accumulation is assiciated with lactic acid fatigue. 

lactic acid is less energy than that produced by the citric acid cycle (up to 38 molecules of ATP). 

regulation of glycolysis COPY IMAGE. no significant trend in free energyies released, however under physiological conditions all most run close to eqilibrium, 

In gluconeogenisis steps 1 3 and 10 of glycolysis have different enzymes. 

## Tricarboxylic acid cycle

Glucose has a lot of potential energy 
the energy produced by glycolysis is onyl a small fraction of that energy
a little more is released in the citric acid cycle, most energy is released in oxidative phosphrylation.
