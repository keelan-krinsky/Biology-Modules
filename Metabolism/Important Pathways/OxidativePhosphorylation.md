# Oxidative phosphroylation
Electrons channelled through ETC proteins to $O_2$, the final electron acceptor. Proton gradient established across mitochondrial membrane contains energy to drive ATP synthesis. 


## Background
Occurs without the dirrect interaction with the substrate but rather from the transfer of electrons form an ATP sythase membrane protein. Energy required for phosphorylation is provided by redox reactions.

## Substrate level phosphorylation
Occurs via dirrect interactrion with an organic substrate, in which the endergonic ATP synthesis reaction is coupled to an exergonic catabolic reaction. The substrate provides the energy required for phosphorylation, though hydrolysis of a high energy bond. 

## Location 

### Mitochondrial 

#### Consitituents

##### Outer membrane
Packed with Porin,(makes pores in membrane allowing free diffusion of any substance smaller than 10kD)

##### Inner Membrane
Packed with proteins, but impermiable to moleulces and ions. Membrane folded inwards to form cristae maximizing surface area to volume area, to increase the number of protein. 
When the mitochoria is very active the inner membrane shrinks, and the intermembrane space expands. 

##### Inter membrane space
Packed with enzymes which utalised ATP 

## ATP synthase

### Structure 

#### $F_0$ unit
the $F_0$ unit located within the membrane contains 3 hydrophobic subunits ($a_1, b_2, c_{8-15}$).

##### a subunit
the a subunit contains 5 hydrophobic helices, and two half channels. 

#### $F_1$ unit 
The $F_1$ unit located on the matrix side of the inner membrane contains 5 polypeptide chains ($\alpha_3 \beta_3, \gamma, \delta, \epsilon$) 

## Mechanism of ATP synthesis

### Boyer experiment
$^{18}O$ labeled water was added to a reaction mix. ADP and phosphate react to from enzyme bound ATP, (an eqillibrium is formed). this ATP can then be hydrolysed with the labeled water (also in eqilibirum ) to form ADP and labeled phosphate. and phosphate in the absence of a proton gradient, labeled water is then incoperatied into the phsphate formed from ATP hydrolysis. 

### Binding change mechanism for ATP synthesis

#### Step One
$ADP$ and $Pi$ bind to the L conformation of ATP synthase. The Loose (L) conformation has a low affinity for the ligand, and so ADP and P bindin its place. In the tight conformation ATP synthesis occurs. The open conformation has no affinity for the ligand so any bound ligand will be released. 

#### Step Two
The L conformation changes to the T confomration, and the T conformation turns to the O conformation releasinf the previously bound ATP. The P conformation changes to the L conformation and becomes ready to bind ADP. 

#### Step Three
ATP synthesis occurs in the T site.

### General mechanism of action
A bound proton is burined via clockwise rotation of the alpha-helix. Each c-ring remains protonated when in the membrane, and the protons ride the c subunit rotor round the ring in an anticlockwise direction to the outlet channel. New protons enter from the inlet channel. 

R210 promotes the transfer of the entering protons from the a-subunit N214 to the c-subunt D61 and the transfer of the exiting protons from D61 to S206. The inlet ends in N214 and outle tneds in S206. R210 forms H-bonds with D61 on two adjacent subunits.

2 NADH are produced per glucose in the cytosol via glyceraldehyde 3-P dehydrogenase. The NADH ,must be oxidsised to regenerate $NAD^+$ which occurs via the shuttle system. The process can occur irreversible to form glycophosphate or reversible to from malate-aspartate. in the glycophosphate shuttle NADH is oxidised by dihydrozyactetone to form glycerphosphate. dihydroxyacetone phosphate is regenrated by reduction of glycerol-3-phosphate by FAD group of favoprteinfour within the mitochonrial inner membrane. the electrons transfered in this oxidationpass directly to UQ in the formation of $UQH^2$ in the electron transport chain. 

In the malate-asparatate shuttle 
NADH is oxidised in the reduction of oxaloacetate, and in the matrix NAD^+ is reduced in the dehydrogenation of malate to oxaloacetate. NADH is free to enter the ETC dirrectly.
