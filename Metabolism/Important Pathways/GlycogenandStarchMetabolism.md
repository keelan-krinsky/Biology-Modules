# Glycogen and Starch Metabolism

### Structure

#### Glycogen 
$\alpha$ 1-4 linkages with $\alpha$ 1-6 linkages, there is only one reducing end per glycogen (same with startch)

>NOTE: alpha yj OH is in the cis configuration. 

$\alpha$ Amalyase is an endoglycosidase. 
hydrolyses $\alpha 1-4$ glycosidic linkages at random positions, maltose, maltotriosem and small oligosaccharides. limit dextrins are left over as the $\alpha$ 1-6 bonds cannot be easily cleaved. glycogeon phosphoralyase in animals is an exoglycosidase cleaving off the last glucose. the phoshporysis reactive unti to alpah D -glucose 1 phoasphate, which can enter glycolysis dirrectly. limit dexteracne are still produced. 

Branching alows for more rapid breakdown, as the exoglycosidases can only act of free ends. 

additionaly enzymes are required to debranch the limit detxterans. 

### Debarnching enzyme
cuts off a section from the branch and adds it to the long chain, however it still cannot cleave the 1-6 bond, cleaves one to four of the link just behind it. alpha 1-6 unit activity of the enzyme is then used to cleave off the isolated branch glucose. the main section cut off is added to the reducingt rsedction of the main chain.


an unbranched bolysaccheride with one fewer glucose is the end product.
