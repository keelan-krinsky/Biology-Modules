import Glycolysis as Glycolysis 

import LinkReaction as LinkReaction

# Glucose Metabolism 
Glucose has a lot of potential energy, the energy released in glycolysis is only a small fraction of that energy a little more is released in the citric acid cycle, but most of the energy is released in oxidative phosphorylation. 

## ATP Production
30-38 molecules of ATP generated per molecule of glucose, 2 from glycolysis, 2 from TGA and the rest from the ET.

## Electron Transfer
24 high energy electrons are removed in complete oxidation of glucose. 

## __Glycolysis: Glycolysis__

## __LinkReaction: Link Reaction__

## __TricarboxylicAcidCycle: TricarboxylicAcid Cycle__

The Net reaction from glycolysis to the end of the Citric Acid Cycle is:\newline 
$Glucose _2Pi+4NAD^++2ADP \rightarrow 10NADH + 2FADH_2+4ATP+ 6CO_2+10H^++4CoASH$
