# Beta Oxidation

## Fatty Acid catabolism: $\beta$-oxidation 

better than sugars for storage as very good at packing. 

### fatty acids, cpmefrpmdiet make up 60\% of the callories divided into fatty acids, and triacyl glycerols. major stored energy reserve of fatty acids. stored as large aggregated modules is agrigocytes. 

how they are broken down and how they provide energy. complete combustion of fat os 37Kj/g where as sugars are onyl 17.

tryacyl glycerols go into stomach, a small portion of these will be broken up into lipases. Then reaces the doudenum where alkaline pancreatic lipases htfrolyse TAGs at C1 and C3, esterases hydrolyse ester linkages. FAs+ glycerol made into new TAGs and lipoproteins. 

aceyl co A synthetiase catalyses the addition of acetyl-coA to the end of the fatty acid. The CoA comes from TCA cycle. 

step 2
	oxidation at the beta carbon. cleavage between the alph and beta carbon releases acetyl co A and the cycle can begin again each cycle u\yield four electrons 2 in FADH_2 and 2 in NADH, in the addition of coASH ATP is hydrolysed to form AMP and PP pyrophospahte. second step is hydrolysis of pyrophosphate releasing more energy. this second hydrolysis is required to close the eqillibrium, so 2 ATP equivalents are used up. oxidation via FAD reduction removal of $H_2$. a double bond is formed electrons were released protons were removed. 

	hydration reaction, water added across doulbe bond, then another oxidation reaction, sending electrons to NAD to from NADH the FADH_2goesby flavoprotein 3 into the ETC. after the second oxidation a carboyl group forms on the beta carbon which primers the $\alpha$ beta bond for cleavage. two carbons area chopped off from the long chain. re adds coA (which does not require ATP as release of the two carbon compound provides enough energy, so only the first time coA is added is energy required.n /2 acetl n/2-1 coenzymes:)




## $\beta oxidation$
7 cycles of $\beta oxidation$. (the last group will already be acetyl coA), 1.5 ATP from each fadH and 2.5 ATP from eadch NADH. the numbers are just an estimate. for a chain n long there are n/2 acetycoAS produced and n/2-1 reduced coenzymes. 

NOTE: remember the ATP used up at the start of fatty acid metabolism. 

### odd number fatty acids. 
one three carbon unit propionyl-CoA 3C. undergoes three enzyme catalsed reactions to rpduce succinyl-CoA. Succinyl CoA has four carbons. succinyl-CoA via the citric acid cycle can be converted to oxaloactetate. in this metabolism there is 1 nadh and 1 fadh2 produced. So oaxaloacetate will be converted to succinyl -CoA pyruvate. 1 ATP equivalent is used. the PEP produced from oxaloacetate can be conveted to pyruvate. pyruvate converted to acetyl co A with the production of one Acetyl CoA and TCA cycle, in which 3 NADH 1 ATP equivalnet 1 FADH_2

overall 2 FADH_2 1atp and 5 NADH.  overall 16.5. 

No $FADH_2$ can be produced when there is a cis bond.
