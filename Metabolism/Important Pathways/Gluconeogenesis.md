# Gluconeogenesis
In gluconeogenesis steps 1 3 and 10 of glycolysis have different enzymes. 


happens in the cytosol. 

### PEP carboxykinase in matrix and cytosol. Oxaloacetate can leave the matrix as malate (or asparate). oxaloacetate is converted to malate, to be moveed across the membrane, malate is then oxidised back to oxaloacetate and gluconeogensis can commentce. Pyruvate is converted onto the mitochondrion at the end of the cirtr4ic acid cycle. pyruvate carboxylase used to convert it to oxaloacetate or PDC used to convert it to acetyl co A, which is made into citrate (which can go to fatty acid synthesis or TCA cycle). Oxaloacetate can go to the citric acid cycle or it can be the starting poitn for gluconeogenesis. 

phosphoenol pyruvate is a high energy compound as the enol is an unstable form. To make phosphoenol pyruvate from oxaloacetate PEP carboxykinase is used and GTP is required. carbon dioxide is removed. in the first reaction a carbon is added in the second reaction it is removed. this is necessary as they decarboxylation which is very favourable energetically helps to from the very high energy phosphoenol pyruvate. decarboxylation is a favourable process that helps to form the very high energy PEP, hence the first reaction is essentially a priming reaction.

2rd from last 
fructose 1,6 bisphosphatase.  fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6 phosphate. hydrolysis of phosphoester bond therefore thermodynamically favourable. allosteric regulation. citrate fructose 2,6 bisphosphate. if there is alot of citrate there is no need to brak down glucose to make more citrate, instead in can be built up. 

last reaction 
glucose-6 phosphitase reaction 
final step, glucose is the product from G-6P this reaction does not occur in the cytosol, it happens within the endoplasmic reticulum. hydrolysis occurs to creaate glucose and phosphate. the glucose and the phosphate are released into the cytosol separately. glucose has to then get into the blood so it can be transproted to the brain of mucles, the GLUT 2 tasnporter is used. 

net reaction: 

$2 pyruvate+4ATP+2GTP +2NADH+2H^++6H_2O\rightarrow glucose+4ADP+2GDP+6Pi+2NAD^+$ $\Delta G =-37.7kj.mol$

>NOTE: GTP hydrolysis is slightly less energy than ATP hydrolysis. 

gluconeogenesisi is exergonic whilethe reverse of glycolysis is not this is bacuse 5\4 additional high energy phosphate bonds are hydrolysed which provides the
