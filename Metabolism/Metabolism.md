# Metabolism 
The process of metabolism involves the generation of energy and the synthesis of biomolecules

## Background  
Metabolism is the sum of chemical changes which convert nutrients into energy and products via specific chemical intermediates. Metabolism is organised into a number of discrete pathways, and governed by a relatively small set of relatively simple rules. 

### __Kinetics: Kinetics__

### Evolutionary History
Many important metabolic pathways are ancient, originating billions of years ago. For example glycolysis evolved as an anaerobic process because it is so old that it originated when there was still very low atmospheric oxygen concentration. These ancient pathways make up a basic set of metabolic pathways common to almost all organisms. Metabolic variation between organisms and higher taxa relates more often to differences in the regulation, or number and identity of intermediates in theses core pathways, than from development of entirely new pathways. Different cells and organisms may express different pathways to different extents, adding diversity to metabolic processes. 

> NOTE: Anabolic synthesis of a given end product is not identical to the catabolic pathway of the same substrate. For example, of the ten enzymes active in glycolysis only 7 are also active in gluconeogenesis, and four additional enzymes are also required. 

## Important Pathways

### __CoenzymeCycles: Coenzyme Cycles__

### __Glycolysis: Glycolysis__

## Regulation
The regulation of catabolism and anabolism are separate, as they have different regulation points, hence even if many reactions are shared between the catabolic and anabolic pathway at least sum key regulating steps must differ. Both catabolic and anabolic pathways must be regulated simultaneously, or they may counteract each other wasting energy. 
simultaneous regulation ensures that the cell's chemical needs can be fulfilled in an immediate and orderly fashion. 

> NOTE: The evolutionary/physiological reason why pathways cannot go both ways is that there would then be no way up regulating the pathway to produce more or less product as required.  

### Separation
Competing metabolic pathways (such as paired catabolic and anabolic pathways) are segregated into different cellular compartments, chemically and spatially separating their intermediates, to avoid any interference.

### Regulation Points 
Points of regulation involve reactions in which the equilibrium is shifted very strongly in one direction. Such reactions have a very high change in free energy associated with them. 

#### Stage 2 
amino acids to alpha keto acids, and then pyruvate or acetylp co A 
glycerol and glucose to pyruvate. and fatty acids to acetyl CoA. 
pyruvate can be further brocked down into acetyl-coA (the common end product of metabolism

final waste products are carbon dioxide and water.
