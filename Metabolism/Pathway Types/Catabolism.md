# Catabolism
Breaking down. catabolism is used to generate energy to drive biosynthesis, an anabolic process. Catabolism is endothermic but entropically favoured. Normally an oxidative process. Catabolism is the breakdown of complex nutrients (carbohydrates lipids and proteins), into smaller substituents such as lactic acid carbon dioxide, urea ammonia nad ethanol. excergonic. oxidative, (high energy electrons are removed from the substrate). to electron carriers, such as $NAD^+$, $NADP^+$ and FAD, co-enzymes. which are reduced to $NADH$ $NADPH$ and $FAD_2$. these conenzymes can then be used in the reductive biosyntheis reactions of anabliism. this energy producing process is required for oxidative processes. reduced coenzymess are oxidised to release energy. (this energy is required to build up large molecules. )

#### Stage 1 
large completx molecules into their building bocks. 

#. Carbohydrate biuld from monosacherides. 
 
### Lipids. 
fatty acids and glycerol 

 ### proteins 
amino acids.

NOTE: the synthesis of a molecule takes more energy than the break down provides, (as energy is lost in unusable forms such as heat)
