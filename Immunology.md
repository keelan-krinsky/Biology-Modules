# Immunology

## Background
Microscopic organism have been observable since the 1670s whith the production of the first microscopes. These organsisms can be unicelluat or multicellular, proaryotic or eukaryotic. The most common micro-organims are bacteria, archae, and fungi, with viruses forming a separate brannch of non living micro molecules.

### Robert Koch
Koch came up with a method for confirming the relationship between a particular micro-organism and a particular disease known as kochs postulate for which he won a nobel prize.

#### Kochs postulate
Kochs postulate can be spilt into a number of steps/ requirments. If and only if all of there requirments are met then the microorganism in question can be considered to be the causative agent of the disease.

##### Requirments
(The microbe must be obervable present in every  case of the disease. )  #. The microbe must be obervalbe/ isolated from a sick individual
 #. The microbe after isolation and identification is cultured in the lab and then injected into another healthy individual.
    #. The healthy individual must become sick (ie injected microbe causes the disease in a healthy individual)
    #. The same microbe must be present/ isolated from the newly infected individual.

NOTE: Positive identification of the microbe will rely on microscope work.

### Non Pathogenic microbes.  
Not all micro-organisms are pathogenic. In fact humans have many mutualistic or commensal microbes living in and on them. These microbes are collectively reffered to as the microbiome and account for 1-2 kg of an average individuals weight.  


### Defintitions.

#### Prokaryotes

Prokaryotes are classified as they are lving organsism which consist of cells, but lack a nucleus. They do have a cell wall, but lack a cytoskeleton, internal membranes, organelles. In general they are also quite small <$5\mu m$ in diameter, and are always unicellular.

#### Eukaryotes.
Eukaryotes are living organisms comprised of cells which possess a nucleus. Eukaryotes are generally large cells .$10 \mu m$ and can be uni or multicellular. Eukarryotic cells contain a cytoskeleton, internal membranes, organelles and in some cases a cell wall (such as in plants and fungi)

#### Pathogen
A pathogen is an infectious micro-organsim that causes disease.

##### Examples

###### Potato blight
Plant fungal infection resonsilbe for irish famine in the 1800s

###### Bacteriophage
Phages are viruses which infect bacteria, they may provide an alternative treatment to some antibiotics.

###### Rinderpest
A Cattle Virus which killed 90\% of cows in SA in the 1890s. (the virus is now eradicated)

###### Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)
Bacterial which kills a particular insect which ingests it, it has been used in commercial pesticides.


#### Host.
A host is the species/individual which becomes infected, and gets sick from a pathogen. This host will mount an immune response against the pathogen. Any form of living organism can be a host.

NOTE: many pathogens are sepcies specific infection only one particular host for example HIV infects humans where as SIV infects monkeys(?)

#### Immunology
Immunology is the study of the immune system, that is ther study of the bodies natural protection from foriegn macromolecules (worm, parasite, viral protein etc) or invading organism and respoces to them.

#### Immune system
A collection of specialsied tissues and cells which can, recognise pathogens, distinguish self from non self molecules/cells, and react to eliminate pathogens.

NOTE: Unicelluar prokaryotes like bacteria have a versy simple enzyme based defence system called CRISPR.

Eukaryotes: invertibrates, plants, and vertibrates all have innate immunity.

Jawed vertibrates have a particularly advanced immune system which includes adaptive immunity.


### Domains of life.
As well as being separated in prokaryotes and eukaryotes life is also separated into three domains, an idea first concieved by Woese.

#### Bacteria
Prokaryotes

##### Common human pathogens
Bacteria in general are common human pathogens, although by no means will all bacterial species be pathogenic.

#### Archaea
Prokaryotes

##### Common human pathogens
Archaea live in extreme environments and therefore are not pathogen to humans as the human body does not provide a suitable environment for their growth.

#### Eucaryota
Eukaryotes.

##### Common human pathogens
Animals, Funig, Flagellates, Trichomonads, Microsporia, and Diplomonads are all common human pathogens.

### Common human Pathogens.

#### Bacteria
eg escherichia coli.

##### Description
Single celled organisms without a nucleus.

##### Human diseases
Strep throat, Staph infeftions, tuberculosis, food posioning, tetanus, pneumonia, syphilis.

#### Viruses
eg Herpes virus

##### Description
Thread-like particles that reproduce using host cell machinary.

##### Human diseases
Common cold, flu, genital herpes, cold sores, measles, AIDS, genital warts, chicken pox, small pox.

#### Fungi
eg Death cap mushroom

##### Description
Simple organisms including mushrooms and yeasts, which can grow as single cells or threadling fillaments of coencytic cells.

##### Human diseases
Ring worm, Athlete's foot, tinea candidiasis, histoplasmosis, mushroom posioning.  

#### Protozoa
eg Giardia lamblia

##### Description

Single celled organism with a nucleus.

##### Human diseases
Malaria, "travelers diarrhea", giardiasis, trypanosomiasis ("sleeping sickness")

## Innate Immunity
The inate immune system has components which naturally exist in the body and which can respond very fast (to patterns of amino acids of saccharides). The system does not have to learn or develop over time, but is not very sepcific and has no memory (ie the respoce will be indetical if the infectino reoccurs. )

### Why innate immunity is necessary
Pathogen can multiply very fast. Ecoli for examples doubles every 30 minutes leading to $2 \cdot 10^{143}$ bacteria in # days. whereas the adaptive immune system requires at least 3 days, and potentially closer to 14 days to respond.

### Barriers
Barriers inclue many tissues and organs within the body. The barriers can also take non many different forms such as anatomical,mechanical, chemical, and microbial.

#### Skin
The skin predominately a physical barrier, but can also be considered a chemical barrier due to its lower PH

#### Mucous membranes
Mucous membranes are present in the respiritory and reproductive tract and also pose a predominately physical barrier to pathgens trapping them in the mocus layer.

#### Microbiome
A microbial barrier the mcrobiome acts to full up all of the availbe ecological niches for microprganisms in the human body provind competition for any pathogen seeking to invade.

#### Stomach
The stomach poses a cheimcal barrier due to its very low pH and high enzyme content.


### Pathogen recognition
Non specific, recognises pathgen patterns.

### Receptors
Small set/ limited variety.

### Memory
No memory mechansims, subsequent exposures illicit an identical responce.

### Speed
Immediate responce, within hours.

### Species
All vertibrates.

### Cells and tissues

#### Barriers
Anatomic and physiological, such as inflamation.

#### Cells general
phagocytes, NK cells,

#### Humoral
Complement antimicrobial peptides.

### Cell types

#### Granulocytes

##### Functions
 #. Phagocytosis
 #. Cytolysis (Cytotoxic)
 #. Cytokine production/release

##### Neutrophils

##### Basophils

##### Eosinophils
 #. Allergic reactions

#### Lymphocytes

##### NK cells.
 #. Cytolysis
 #. Cytokine release/production

#### Monocytes
##### Functions
 #. Phagocytosis
 #. Antigen presentation
 #. Cytokine production/release

##### Monocyes

##### Macrophages.

##### Dendritic cells.


## Adaptive immunity
Components respond specifically to the invading pathogen. A memory is developed for that pathoen,and the responce to subsiquent infections with of that pathogen are much faster and more vigorous.

### Pathogen recognition
Very specific recognises particular pieces of particular pathogens.

### Receptors
Very large variety.

### Memory
Memory from one exposure leads to increased responce on subsequent exposures.

### Speed
Several days are required for responce to develop, unless it is a memory responce in which case the responce is very fast.

### Species
Only jawed vertibrates

### Cells and tissues.

#### Cells General
B and T cells.

#### Humoral
Antibodies.

## Physical barriers
Physical barriers such as the skin provide the first line of defence to any prosepctive antigen.

NOTE: a disease which inavdes physical barriers, the innate and the adaptive immune system will become a chronic infection.

### Cells.

#### T lymphocytes

##### CD4 T Cells
 #. Cytokine production

##### CD8 T Cells
#. Cytolysis (Cytotoxic)

#### B lymphocytes.

 #. Antibody production/release
 #. Antigen presentation.

## Location of the immune system

### Blood.
Cells (ie white blood cells)
Consitiuets of the blood plasma.

NOTE: some immune disorders can de diagnosed purely by lookign at blood samples.

#### Cell types
Cetrifugation of blood gives three layers.

##### bottom layer
Contains red blood cells (Erythrocyes), and makes up about 45\% of the blood. Red blood cells are specialised to carry oxygen.


##### Middle Layer (Buffy coat)
Contains white blood cells (leukocytes),and platlets  makes up about 1 \% of the blood. Platelets thrombocytes are important for blood clotting.

##### Top layer
Plasma makes up about 55\% of the blood. The plasma contains immune system non-cellular components such as antibodies, and complememnts.

### Tissues fluid

### Lymph
The lymph is very similar to blood plasma, and contains lynphocytes and other white bloof cells in addition to tissue fluid. It also contains waste products alogn with bacteria and proteins.

The lymph circulatory system is not closed, like blood vessels are, Rather lymph enters the lymph in cappilary beds and is returned to the blood vial the subclavina veins.

Lymphocytes within the lymph are concentrated at the lymph nodes.


### Tissues and organs.

#### Lymph nodes and vessles.

#### Physical barriers such as skin

#### Specialised organs such as appendix and tonsils.

#### Gut and lungs.

#### Mocosal surfaces.

#### Bone marrow and thymus.


## Leukocytes.

### Granulocytes
Cells contain lots of small granules visible under a micropscope. The nucleus is subdivided into sections. Theses cells are also known as polymorphonuclear PMN cells.

#### Neutrophils

#### Basophils

#### Eosinophils


### Lymphocytes
no granules, one smooth nucleus

#### T cells

#### B cells

#### NK cells


### Monocytes.
monocytes remain mononcytes when in the blood once they move out into the tissue they differentiate into macropahges and dendtritic cells.

#### Macrophages

#### Dendritic cells
no granules, one smooth nucleus. Monocytes are slightly larger and have rougher edges than lymphocytes.

## Immune system development.

### Haematopoiesis
Haematopoiesis  is the development of blood cellular components. It occurs in hramatopoietic stem cells (HSC) found in the bone marrow. Thses HSCs give rise to all blood cell types incuding platelets, red blood cells, and white blood cells.


NOTE: in a healthy person about $10^{12}$ new blood cells are produced every day.

## Identifying Immune cells
The size and complexity of an immune cell, along with surfae markers are used to indentify a particular immmune cell type. Each cell displays partilucar types of proteins on its cell surface known as cluster of differentiation (CD) markers. There are approximately 350 differe tCD atigents for human white blood cells.

### Florencent tagging
Fourecently tagged antibodies specific to particular cell surface recpetors could be used to indetify a particular cell type known to have those recepors as the florecently tagged antibodies would bind to those receptors and cells in question would glow a particular color when viewed under a (florescent) microscope.

### Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry also uses specific florecent tagging but includes considerations of the size and compelxity/granularity of the cell to give a unique identification.


NOTE: Stem cells are undifferentiated biolgical cells which could give rise to a variety of different specialised cells.

### Markers for common cells.

#### HSC (stem cells)
CD34

#### Leukocytes (All WBS)
CD45

#### Monocytes
CD14

#### Dendritic cells
CD11

#### Granulocytes.
CD66

#### Lymphocytes

##### NK cells.
CD56
CD16

##### B Cells

CD20

##### T Cells
CD3

##### Cytotoxic T cells
CD8

##### Helper T cells
CD4

## Immune cell functions

### Phagocytosis

Phyagocytic cells include macropahges dendritic cells and neutrophils.

#### Step #1 Chemotaxis
The macrophaphage sences the pathogenic cells/moelcules, and is attracted towards it by chemical signal transduction, leading to an active chase.  

#### Step #2 Binding
The macrophage extends it pseudopodia to "catch" the pathogen, sticking strongly to it.

#### Step #3 Ingestion
The pathogen is engulf into the macrophage by means of endocytoses, such that the pathogen is now contained within a vacuole (phagosome) within the cell.

#### Step #4 Digestion
Lysosomes within the macrophage fuse with the phagosome introducing lysosomal enzymes to destroy/digest the pathogen.(Lysosomes contain reactive oxygen species in addition to their proteases). The phagocyte is digested/degraded into smaller pieces.

#### Step #5 Exocytosis .
The waste material remaining after diggestion is released by exocytosis  
#### Step #6 Antigen presentation.
some of the digested pathogen constituents are retained and used for  antigen presentation.

#### End result
Destruction of micro-organisms, antigen presentation, and cytokine release.

### Antigen presentation
After phagocytosis the phagocytes retains small pieces of the pathogen, known as antiges. Theses antigens are displayed on the surfacae of the phagocyte, in effect signallying that the pathofen has been detected. This Form of antigen presentation occurs only in phagocytic cell types, (also known as anitgen presenting cells).

#### HLA (MHC)

## Defence mechanisms of the immune system

### Phagocytosis .
Chopping up, degrading the phagocyte

### Cytokines.
Cytokines act to comminicate the presence of an atigen to other immune cells stimulating these cells to take part on the immune responce. antibodies, antigen presentation and inflammation can also act in this regard.

### Cytolysis
Cytolysis involves the injection of cytotoxis into the pathogen of an infected host cell, to distrupt its cell membrane or cell wall, causing its content to leak out and the cell itself to die.

The effectors of cytolysis are complement, cytotoxic granoules and antimicrobial peptides.

### Neutralisation
Antibodies can bind to the pathogen blocking it from binding or entering host cells.

### Cell secretions

#### Neutrophils
Secrete antimicrobial peptides, cytokines and perforin/ cytotoxic granules which lyse target cells.

#### Cytotoxic T cells
Secrete cytokines,(chemical messengers), Perforin of cytotoix granules.

#### NK Cells
excrete perforin/ cytotoxic granules.

#### B cells
Excrete antibodies.
