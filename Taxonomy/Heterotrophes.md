# Heterotrophes
Heterotrophes use organic carbon, such as glucose molecules, as fuel in energy linked metabolism to power non-spontaneous reactions, and as building blocks in anabolism to synthesize their own biomolecules.

>NOTE: Although typically characterised as autotrophes, plants also make use of heterotrophes pathways in their metabolism.
