# Taxonomy
Organisms are classified by how they obtain their source of energy, carbon, and electrons for reduction. Differences in these sources will lead to the evolution of different metabolic pathways in differed clades, for example the evolution photosynthesis in autotrophes. 

## Background

### __Photosynthesis: Photosynthesis__

### __Heterotrophes: Heterotrophes__

## Dominant groups
There are four dominant groups of living organisms. 

### Photoautotrophes
Photoautotrophic cells use energy from Electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectrum, i.e. sunlight, to produce organic compounds such as glucose from (inorganic) carbon dioxide.
