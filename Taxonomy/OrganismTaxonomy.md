# Organism Taxonomy

organisms are classified by how they obtain their carbon and energy. different organisms classified in different ways will have different metabolic pathways, eg photosynthesis in autotrophes. 

photoautotrophic cells synthesize energy from the sun to porduce glucose and oxygen. the reactants are water and carbon dioxide the products are glocuse and oxygen. The heterotrophes use the glucose as fuele and building blocks to synthesie their own biomolecules. (plants can also use heterotrohic pathways.). In this way a cycle is set up.
