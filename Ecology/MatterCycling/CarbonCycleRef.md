# Carbon Cycle


## Carbon cycling


### Fixation

#### Oceans
In the oceans the vast majority of carbon is fixed by phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are particularly abundant on the west coast of South Africa, due to upwelling events, and areas around Antarctica. 

>NOTE: The abundance of phytoplankton can be estimated very well based on the concentration of chlorophyll A in sea water.

## Significance

### Food Supply
 Carbon is a key component of life. Carbon based compounds are required to generate energy and biological molecules during metabolism. 


### Climate control
Carbon dioxide in particular, as well as other carbon containing gasses such as methane are major green house gasses.
These gasses are required for maintenance of the earths surface temperature. Additional carbon in the atmosphere leads to heating additional heating which can have seriously detrimental effects, such as the melting of the polar icecaps, and increased desertification few the $30\circ$ latitudes. 


>NOTE: The Earth, Mars, and Venus, are all within a distance range from the sun where the conditions for life can develop, but without earths atmosphere the plant would still be too cold to support life. 

#### Green house effect
Short wave radiation from the sun is absorbed by earths surface. Some of this radiation is reflected back to space, normally at a lower frequency. Carbon containing gasses trap long wave (IR) radiation from escaping out into space. 


>NOTE: The absorbance of many bonds related to IR absorbance, such as in IR spectra, fro example C-CV and C-H or C-O bonds are present in these gaseous forms. 

The overall green house effect increases the average temperature by about $30^\circ C$

 degrees. 

## Forms

### Inorganic gaseous
Carbon exists in several inorganic gaseous forms for example $CO, CO_2, \text{and} CH_4$

## Movement through ecosystem

### Primary Producers
Primary producers, such as algae are responsible for fixing inorganic (normally atmospheric) carbon, usually in the form of carbon dioxide into organic molecules. Production consumption and transfer of organic materials provides energy for higher tropic levels. 


### Respiration
 All living organisms, autotrophes and heterotrophes alike can catabolize organic (carbon containing) compounds to release energy from from food. 
 

## Reservoirs.
All Carbon is stored in one of 4 major reservoirs, namely, atmosphere, lithosphere, biosphere. 

>NOTE: Biosphere is this content includes carbon in organic molecules (dead of alive), but not the inorganic carbon components of their environment. 	

### Cycle time
The cycle time of the reservoirs ranges from a few to a few million years. The lithosphere is relatively inert, and contains a great deal of carbon, in a rock form. In total it is estimated that the lithosphere contains $10^23$ grams of carbon buried in sedimentary rocks as carbonate minerals $CaCO_3$ $CaMgCO_3$ and $FeCO_3$ and organic compounds such as oils, natural gases, and coal and fossil fuels.

Carbon eventually moves out of the lithosphere by slow metabolic processes, such as chemical weathering and sedimentation. 

> NOTE: common measurement of carbon is in gigatons that in 10^15 grams.


>NOTE: Burning of fossil fuels is removing carbon from the lithosphere at an unprecedentedly high rate, upsetting the natural balance between reservoirs.
