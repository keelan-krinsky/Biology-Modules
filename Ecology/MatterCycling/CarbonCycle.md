# Carbon Cycle

## Fixation 

### Oceans 
In the oceans the vast majority of carbon is fixed by phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are particularly abundant on the west coast of South Africa, due to upwelling events, and areas around Antarctica. 

>NOTE: The abundance of phytoplankton can be estimated very well based on the concentration of chlorophyll A in sea water.

## Significance

### Food Supply
 Carbon is a key component of life. Carbon based compounds are required to generate energy and biological molecules during metabolism. 


### Climate control
Carbon dioxide in particular, as well as other carbon containing gasses such as methane are major green house gasses.
These gasses are required for maintenance of the earths surface temperature. Additional carbon in the atmosphere leads to heating additional heating which can have seriously detrimental effects, such as the melting of the polar icecaps, and increased desertification few the $30\circ$ latitudes. 


>NOTE: The Earth, Mars, and Venus, are all within a distance range from the sun where the conditions for life can develop, but without earths atmosphere the plant would still be too cold to support life. 

#### Green house effect
Short wave radiation from the sun is absorbed by earths surface. Some of this radiation is reflected back to space, normally at a lower frequency. Carbon containing gasses trap long wave (IR) radiation from escaping out into space. 


>NOTE: The absorbance of many bonds related to IR absorbance, such as in IR spectra, fro example C-CV and C-H or C-O bonds are present in these gaseous forms. 

The overall green house effect increases the average temperature by about $30^\circ C$ degrees. 

#### Anthropic Activity
Overall anthropic activity single the industrial revolution has lead to a rise in the $CO_2$ concentration in the atmosphere from 280ppm to 360 ppm. 

#### Fossil Fuels 
The burning of fossil fuels increases $CO_2$ concentration within the atmosphere. 

#### Deforestation
Deforestation leads to decreased carbon fixation from the atmosphere. about 2 Gt of anthropogenic carbon dioxide is absorbed by the oceans each year. Some is unaccounted for. 


## Fluxes 	

### Primary Producers
Primary producers, such as algae are responsible for fixing inorganic (normally atmospheric) carbon, usually in the form of carbon dioxide into organic molecules. Production consumption and transfer of organic materials provides energy for higher tropic levels. 


### Respiration 
 All living organisms, autotrophes and heterotrophes alike can catabolize organic (carbon containing) compounds to release energy from from food. 
 
### Hydrosphere Atmosphere Exchange
$CO_2$ is very soluble in water and so there is a significant exchange between atmospheric carbon dioxide and dissolved carbon dioxide most notable in the marine environment. $CO_2$ in the atmosphere forms a relatively stable equilibrium with dissolved $CO_2$ in the oceans. 

>NOTE: Rate of exchange is increased by wind and turbulence which increase surface area for mixing. 

#### Physical Pump/ Solubility Pump  

>DEFINITION: The Solubility pump is the transfer of $CO_2$ from the atmosphere to the oceans through physical processes. 

The exchange of carbon dioxide between the sea and the atmosphere is mediated by physical processes. Moving from the equator towards the poles, there is a decrease in atmospheric temperature, and hence temperature of the surface water. $CO_2$ is more soluble in cooler waters and so the equilibrium between atmospheric and dissolved carbon dioxide shifts. Decreasing temperature leads to increased density and the as a result the distinct water layers of the sea start to break down. Eventually at the pools the surface water has cooled sufficiency that it sinks down to the deep waters, joining the great ocean conveyor belt at around 4000m. 

>NOTE: As the resonance time of this circulation is very long, several thousands of years, $CO_2$ concentrations in these deep waters (or at the points where these waters begin to rise), can act as tags indicating the historical atmospheric $CO_2$ concentrations 

>NOTE: This sinking water will have a high $CO_2$ concentration, as it is at this point very cold.

>HEURISTIC: The saturation point of $CO_2$ roughly doubles moving from about $20^\circ C$ to $0^\circ C$ sea water.  


As water in the mixed zone moves from the tropics to wards the poles it will cool and through physical mixing will dissolve more carbon dioxide, 

>NOTE: even though at the tropics and at high latitudes are saturated with $CO_2$ the p $CO_2$ at high latitudes is much higher  (more than double) 

When water is cold enough at the poles, its density is sufficiently high that it it sinks taking $CO_2$ rich water from the surface to the deep 2000-4000m forming the new carbon dioxide dense water which joins the ocean conveyor belt at about 4000m down. 
the new $CO_2$ rich dense water joins the conveyor belt. 

The older pre-industrial water has partial pressure signature of 280ppm newer water has signature of 360ppm. Serves as further evidence of elevated $CO_2$ levels in the atmosphere. 




#### Biological Pump  
The biological pump described the movement of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the hydrosphere due to biological processes. Although there is only about 3Gt of biota in the ocean, about 50 Gt of carbon dioxide is fixed by the biota from the atmosphere per year. Phytoplankton in particular are of great importance in fixation.

>NOTE: The biological pump acts to augment the existing $CO_2$ gradient.  

COPY CONCEPTUAL DIAGRAM. 

##### Process
$CO_2$ is fixed into organic compounds by phytoplankton within the surface waters. This fixed carbon which is now in the form of organic carbon is transferred up through the aquatic food web, moving up trophic levels by carnivory and assimilation. From this food web the fixed carbon is released as dead organic carbon in the form of fecal pellets or aggregates. The aggregates are flocculated, normally by the action of diatoms which secrete a sticky mucus layer over these  particles when feeding. Once the aggregates reach sufficient size, and density they sink though the pycnocline into the deep ocean layer. Much of the sinking carbon is in the form of particular organic matter (POC), although there is also a component of dissolved organic matter (DOC), produced by the biota. This sinking involves physical mixing and convection overturn. I

>QUESTION: Do phytoplankton use dissolved or atmospheric $CO_2$.

>NOTE: The sinking PIC is referred to as marine snow. 

>NOTE: There is also dissolved organic carbon within the water. 


DOC, PIC,DIC and POC, can all be transported actively to depth by the vertical migration of organisms for example zooplankton, such as copepods, or larger animals such a whales which feed on the surface water and excrete and respire the consumed organic matter at depth (below the pycnocline). Calcium carbonate in the form of skeletal matter is also transferred across to deep waters, contributing to the establishment of the DIC vertical gradient. 

##### Limitations
The biological pump is limited by by factors such as nutrient supply and community structure nutrients. 

###### Nutrients 
nitrogen, phosphorous, silicon and Iron are all important nutrients which can be limiting in a marine environment, especially in open oceans. 

####### Iron 
Iron in particular is often extremely limited in aquatic environments. The effect of this limitation is seen by winds blowing across Africa which transfer high iron content dust into the Atlantic. In the regions affected by the dust there is a dramatic increaser in primary production. Metal pollution, also, has lead to increase in phytoplankton production in the oceans. 

###### Cell Size
Phytoplankton cell size affects the contribution to the biological pump, as small cells such as picoplankton must be processed though more trophic links before they form large enough aggregated to sink. $CO_2$ fixed by larger cells such as diatoms will be transferred more directly and hence more efficiently.



#### Bicarbonate Pump
Many marine phytoplankton eg coccolithotrophes, and zooplankton pteropods and formanifera have calcareous skeletons formed by calcification. When the cell breaks down calcium carbonate aggregates are formed.

### Within the Hydrosphere
Within the hydrosphere the concentration of carbon dioxide is maintained at a reasonable low level despite the large flux of carbon dioxide into surface waters from the atmosphere because carbon dioxide reacts very quick with water to form carbonic acid. 

$CO_2+H_2O\rightarrow H_2CO_3$  This reaction has a very high rate and is shifted far towards the right.

>HEURISTIC: For every 20 $CO_2$ which dissolve 19 will be converted to carbonic acid within milliseconds. 

The carbonic acid, with then dissociate to an extent dependant on the pH of the marine environment.

$H_2CO_3\rightarrow H^+ + HCO_3^-$ 

Concentration relative low due to the formation of carbonic acid, the equilibrium between carbonic acid and $CO_2$ is shifted quite far to the left, (19 converted for carbonic acid). 

>NOTE: $CO_2$ is the only major atmospheric gas which is readily soluble water.

## Bjerrum plot
COPY IMAGE.

The Bjerrum plot is simply the dissociation curve for carbonic acid with changing pH. The Ocean is well buffered at a pH of about 8 at which point the concentration of $CO_2$ and $CO_3^{2-}$ are about equal. 

>NOTE: If the PH of the ocean changes then the relative concentrations of each form will also change, which for example provides the link between ocean acidification and the dissolving coral reefs.

### Cycle time
The cycle time of the reservoirs ranges from a few to a few million years. The lithosphere is relatively inert, and contains a great deal of carbon, in a rock form. In total it is estimated that the lithosphere contains $10^23$ grams of carbon buried in sedimentary rocks as carbonate minerals $CaCO_3$ $CaMgCO_3$ and $FeCO_3$ and organic compounds such as oils, natural gases, and coal and fossil fuels.

Carbon eventually moves out of the lithosphere by slow metabolic processes, such as chemical weathering and sedimentation. 

> NOTE: common measurement of carbon is in gigatons that in 10^15 grams.


>NOTE: Burning of fossil fuels is removing carbon from the lithosphere at an unprecedentedly high rate, upsetting the natural balance between reservoirs. 


## Reservoirs.
All Carbon is stored in one of 4 major reservoirs, namely, atmosphere, lithosphere, biosphere. 

>NOTE: The lithosphere although by far the largest carbon store is not always considered in the cycle, simply because its rate of exchange with the other reservoirs is so low. 

>NOTE: Biosphere is this content includes carbon in organic molecules (dead of alive), but not the inorganic carbon components of their environment. 	

### Lithosphere

#### Amount of Storage
The lithosphere is the largest carbon store containing 99.57/% of all carbon in the cycle. 

#### Exchange Rate
The rate of carbon exchange with the other reservoirs is extremely slow. 

### Hydrosphere 

#### Amount of storage
The hydrosphere contains about 0.40\% of all of the carbon within the cycle. 

>NOTE: If the lithosphere is not considered then the hydrosphere contains about 93\% of the carbon within cycle.

### Biosphere
The biosphere contains about about 0.022\% of the carbon within the cycle. 

>NOTE: If the lithosphere is not considered then the biosphere contains about 5\% of the carbon within the cycle.

### Atmosphere 

#### Amount of Storage
The atmosphere contains around 750Gt of carbon(5), which corresponds to only about 0.0075\% of the carbon in the cycle. 

>NOTE: If the lithosphere is not considered in the cycle then the atmosphere contains about 2\% of the carbon within the cycle.

### Forms

### Inorganic gaseous 
Carbon exists in several inorganic gaseous forms for example $CO, CO_2, \text{and} CH_4$
