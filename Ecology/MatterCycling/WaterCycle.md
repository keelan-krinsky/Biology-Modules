# Water Cycle

Water in the atmosphere condenses and falls as precipitation. Once intercepted by the ground this water can flow along the top of the land,(runoff) or infiltrate moving down into the ground water. Water is then returned to the atmosphere via evaporation from the land surface and water bodies, or evapotranspiration from plants. When water may also leave the ground water in the form off run out.
