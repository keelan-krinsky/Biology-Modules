# Salt Cycle

## Fluxes

### Rock erosion

### Undersea volcanoes

### Mid-ocean ridges (underwater hot springs)
Water seeps down through cracks in the lithosphere, taking $Na^+$ and $Mg^{2+}$ ions with it which are lost from the seawater into the earths crust. Once this water reaches the magma it is strongly heated and moves back upwards releasing into the ocean in the form of hot springs. Water picks up, $Fe^3+$ and $Mn^{2+}$, and $PO_4^-$ on its way up which are released into the ocean through the hot vents. 

>NOTE: Hot springs/ thermal vents can be seen to shimmer due to the hot water released.

#### Subduction of ocean crust

#### Uptake by plants
