## Background 

### Definitions 

#### Primary production 
The synthesis of biomass of capture of energy from light and nutrients. Biomass becomes 

#### Secondary production 
For heterotrophes, secondary production, is the conversion of consumed biomass to living biomass. 

#### Energy budget 
equation that balances gain of energy (production ) with loss respiration and excretion of waste products. 

#### Transfer effeciency 

##### Consumption effeciency 
how much of the food source is actually consumed 

##### Assimilation effeciency 
how much of the food eaten is actually assimilated, i.e does not pass through the body without being metabolised.  

##### Production energy 
how much of the absorbed biomass actually is converted into living biomass. 
Biomass production = consumption - excretion - respiration. 

#### Net primary prodution 
the amount of biomass available for consumption by heterotrophes. 

#### Gross primary production 
The amount of biomass perminantly fissed by plants. 
Energy is lost by respiration at every trophic level. 


#### Primary producers. 
Secondary consumers,
