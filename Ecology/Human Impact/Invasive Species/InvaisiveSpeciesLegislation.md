# Invasive Aquatic Species Legislation

## South Africa

### History
In South Africa For a long period of time there was no legislation governing the management of invasive aquatic species at all. Furthermore for a long period after that there where many local ordinances to ensure the survival of invasive fish species, due to their commercial and recreational importance, for example fishing of such species during breeding their breeding season was prohibited. By the 1980s neither local nor invasive fish had any form of legal protection, and indeed it was not until the 2000s. 


### First Legislation Drafted.
The First legislation drafted was in the form of a species list which it was envisaged the national government would be responsible for compiling and local governance would be responsible for regulating. The compilation process took a long time, mainly because of a lack of research regarding the ecological effect of aquatic invasive available, on which policy decision could be made, so was only prepared by 2013.This draft contained several different categories of species. 

##### Category 1b
For species in Category 1b most uses are prohibited and control is required. For example species such as Carp and Bass.

#### Category 2
Species May be utilised by those granted legal permits. For example several antelope species. This category however originally contained no fish species, and as a result the entire draft was decidedly unpopular.

#### Lobbying
Due to its unpopularity there was much lobbying against the first species list drafted. In particular the Trout SA lobby group, which consisted of Aquaculture companies as well as recreational fishers was very active in lobbying government and influencing the press. The aim of the association was for trout to be de-listed as an invasive species due to the socio-economic importance of the trout industry. As a result of this lobbying the 2103 Draft was never pasted into law,and instead a new list was drafted. 

### First legislation
After the rejection of the first draft, a new draft was prepared in 2014, which was passed into law. The new draft maintained the same general categories but shifted many fish species into category 2, depending on their geographic position and location along the catchment. Trout,however, were not shifted. Such species would typically be category 1b within natural waterbodies, and category 2 within dams which formed important fisheries. In this case a permit was required for catch and release in line with the general requirements for category two, and release into a different location was strictly prohibited. Citizens who find Bass (or other 1b species?) outside of an assigned fishery area are obliged to kill them.
