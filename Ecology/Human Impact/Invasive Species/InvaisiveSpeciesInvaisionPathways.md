# Invasive Species Invasion Pathways

## Aquarium Trade
Many invasive fish are introduced via the aquarium trade. Fish are often bought for domestic aquariums and then dumped into freshwater systems when they become too large for their holding tank. For example the algae eating plau fish, a common aquarium fish looks very similar to sailfish armoured catfish which grow to about five times the size of the plau fish. Along with these fish the aquatic plants from the aquarium are also introduced into the local system. 

## Ballast tanks 
Many ships move between marine and freshwater, taking water into or laying water out of their ballast tanks to maintain their buoyancy with cargo on and off loading. Organisms contained within this ballast water can be transported very far from their origin to invade completely new systems. 

## Biofouling 
In biofouling biological organisms such as barnacles or muscles attached to boat hulls. Owners are often legally obliged to remove such organisms from their boats, which can be an expensive process. 

## Parasite Transport
Some parasitic organisms are introduced via a host migration into the new area. Parasites are often transferred by human commuters. For example the diatom _Didymospherica spp_/black snot, which is invasive in bacteria. This species was in fact transferred in the veld soled boots of fly fishers which can remain wet inside for up to 7 days. The _Didymospherica_  invasion negatively impacted the recreational and aesthetic value of rivers. 

## Shipping Canals
Shipping canals can also serve as a invasion pathway predominately for large predatory invertebrates (amphipods).
