# Invasive Species Control Methods 

## Mechanical control 
Mechanical removal in generally only used in the case of an emergency where a complete blockage to an important channel has occurred.

### Disadvantages
Mechanical removal methods are extremely time consuming and often very expensive.Furthermore as their effects are only short lasting, they are completely impractical in the long term.

## Chemical control 
Herbicides are often used to control noxious weeds. 

### Disadvantages
Herbicides are often not very species specific so require very specific application, which in turn requires a well structured application program requiring many person hours. 

## Biocontrol 
Salvina and Eichonia are controlled by a suite of herbivorous insects. 

### Implementation
when introducing a new biocontrol, natural predators from the invasives native range are tested for host specificity prior to importation, strict quarantine and testing is required by law. The Prospective species is tested first to see if it will preferable eat the invasive, and secondly to see if it will starve before eating local species. To be introduced it must pass both tests. 

### Disadvantages
Biological controls may be ineffective due to problems with establishment of host species due to factors such as climate.
