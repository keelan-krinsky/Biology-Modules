# Invasive Species Eradication
the eradication of Bass in a South Africa reserve was the first ever eradication program to be run within a nature reserve, the project is still ongoing. The invasion of bass was leading to an extinction risk for the Barrydale red fin fish. The proposed intervention was to eradicate bass from a 4km section of the river. 

## History
Small mouth Bass have been present in the catchment from 1943. Bass have had a devastating effect on the native fish of the Rondegat river. 

## Intervention

### Hydrological Interventions.
Among other methods a increased water flow was encouraged to assist the survival of Barrydale red fin fish, which survives better in fast flowing waters. 

### Chemical treatment
Rotenone, a cyclic toxic extracted from legumes, was added to the stream on the upstream side of the designated area, which was neutralised by addition of potassium permanganate at the downstream end. The potassium permanganate was visibly reduced from purple to colorless in the process. Two cages were placed one on either side of the neutralisation line. The bass placed in the down stream cage (the sentinel bass) was required to survive throughout the entire process, which it did. The Bass placed in the upstream cage was required to die, within a short period, and hence was periodically replaced. 


#### Recovery
48 hours after the treatment aquatic insect populations had recovered, and the entire system was recovered after 1 year. 

## Conflict of interests
The area contains the best bass angling venues in the country. The influx of revenue generated from Bass angling is very important for the local economy, supposedly generating more revenue than the Namaqualand daisies. As a result there was a public outcry against the eradication project. However, through much public engagement, in which the proposed and extent of the project was made clear the support of the bass anglers was solicited. This process was vital,as a single antagonized angler could reverse years of research and development by addition a reintroducing a Bass to the rehabilitated section.
