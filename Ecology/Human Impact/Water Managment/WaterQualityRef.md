# Water Quality
Water quality is generally taken as a combination of several different physical and chemical factors. \newline 

># Hydrological Components
>
>## Dissolved inorganic nutrients
>$PO_3^2-$ $NO_3^-$ are generally the most important dissolved inorganic nutrients to consider. Dissolved nutrient concentration forms an important limiting factor in biological growth and productivity. This concentration is normally increased dramatically in areas affected by human activity, i.e. near cities or industrial plants. 
>
>## Dissolved organic nutrients.
>Tannins such as those that lead to the brown coca cola colored waters of western cape rivers are a form of dissolved organic nutrients. 
> 
>## Toxins
>Toxins may occur naturally in a system but are often related to human activities.  The most common toxins encountered are heavy metals and hydrocarbons (such as oil/fuel spills from cars). 

># Physiological Conditions
>
> ># Suspended Solids
>>
> >## Turbidity
>>The turbidity of a water body is the degree to which it absorbs/ blocks the passage of light. The more suspended solid particles there are in the water column, the greater its turbidity. 
>>
> >## Source
>>
> >### Landscape
>>Run off from the landscape is an important contributor of suspended solids. 
>>
> >### River bed.
>>The river bed forms an additional source of solid material for suspension.

>>>NOTE: (Vanishing waters by Dvies and Dae(?) is a good reference book for this section
>>
> >### Shading
>>Increased turbidity can lead to shading of phytoplankton and macrophytes, leading to a decrease in photosynthesis based primary production. 
>>
> >### Predation
>>Turbidity can reduce the ability of visual predators such as fish to hunt effectively. Additionally as there is less primary production there will be a corresponding decrease in primary and secondary (i.e predators) and higher levels of consumption. 
>>
> >### Reproduction
>>Some Marco-invertebrates, such as Caddis flies require clean rock habits, especially for activities such as egg laying, blanketing of benthos by sediment removes their environment. 
>>

> ># Water Temperature
>>Under sea level, atmospheric pressure conditions water will freeze at $0^\circ C$ and boil at $100^{\circ}C$. With increasing altitude, however, the boiling point will decrease as the boiling point is directly proportional to the vapor pressure over the liquid which is directly proportional to the atmospheric pressure, which decreases with increased altitude. This reduction can become quite significant at very high altitudes, for example, water boils at $45^\circ C$ at the top of mount Everest. 
>>
> >## Density Temperature Relationship
>>Due to the hydrogen bonding which occurs in the crystal lattice of ice, water (H_2O$)  in fact most dense just before freezing at temperatures of $0-3.94^\circ C$ 
>>
>>> Question: Is the most dense temperature pressure dependant?
>>
>>In its liquid phase the density of water varies directly with its temperature. Implying that colder water will sink below warmer. This effect is readily observable in large water bodies with relatively low levels of disturbance (lotic). 
>>
> > ># Temperature Profile
>>>The temperature profile is used to depict cyclic (usually annual) changes in water temperature within a water body. Temperature is shown as isotherms with depth plotted against time.

> ># Water Conductivity
>>Conductivity is a measure of the ability of water to conduct electricity. Conductivity is measured in Siemens ($S$), and water conductivity is usually measured in Siemens per unit area, $\muS.cm^{-1}$ for low conductivity headland streams, for highly conductive $mS.cm^{-1}$. Conductivity must always be measured in conjunction with temperature as conductivity varies directly with temperature. Provided the temperature is recorded the reading can be standardized for comparison. 
>>
>>>NOTE: Conductivity is the inverse of resistance
>>
> >## Pollution Indicator
>>Conductivity is a good blanket measure of pollution especially in the case of metal (ion) pollution which significantly increases conductivity. However, some geologies naturally have more metals and therefore higher associated conductivity, so some variation is not necessarily indicative of contamination.
