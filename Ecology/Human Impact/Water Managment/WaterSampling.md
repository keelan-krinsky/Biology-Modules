# Water Sampling

## Sampling
Samples are ideally fully representative of the parent population. More practical and less expensive that testing large volumes of data. 

## Preparation techniques 

## Quality Assurance
All the policies, procedures, and actions, established to provide and maintain a degree of ?
Consistent monitoring/application, duplicate sampling.

### Sampling labels
Sample for accredited institution is typically 

### Equipment maintenance and calibration.
Weight set to check calibration. Externally one a year through calibration laboratory. 



## Applications
Monitor effects of solid waste dispersal.

## Sampling Plan 

### Duration of Sampling

### Sampling frequency 
Must be representative of the of the processes and flow. 


### Planning sampling event 
Organise and review site maps and locations. Consult analytical laboratory before hand. Each lab may use different methods that require specific sampling techniques preservatives or field treatments. Must inform the lab about the parameters which may be present. 

## Sampling procedures
The purpose of the sampling will dictate the procedure used. 

### Sampling containers
May have specific requirements, prepared before hand, to ensure integrity. 

### stored in an ice cooler box $1-4^\circ C$


### Grab samples

### Composite samples.

## Integrity of samples

### Contamination
Sampling receptacle must be sterilised.

## Sample preparation.

### Solidliquid extraction


### Homogenisation 
very common is waste water which commonly has big solids. 

### Sonication 

### dilution


### evaporation


### filtration

### Digestion 
microwave,used for high metal content samples. 

### Physical and Chemical changes

### Biological Processes
