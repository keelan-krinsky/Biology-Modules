# Water Temperature
Under sea level, atmospheric pressure conditions water will freeze at $0^\circ C$ and boil at $100^{\circ}C$. With increasing altitude, however, the boiling point will decrease as the boiling point is directly proportional to the vapor pressure over the liquid which is directly proportional to the atmospheric pressure, which decreases with increased altitude. This reduction can become quite significant at very high altitudes, for example, water boils at $45^\circ C$ at the top of mount Everest. 

## Density Temperature Relationship
Due to the hydrogen bonding which occurs in the crystal lattice of ice, water ($H_2O$)  in fact most dense just before freezing at temperatures of $0-3.94^\circ C$ 

> Question: Is the most dense temperature pressure dependant?

In its liquid phase the density of water varies directly with its temperature. Implying that colder water will sink below warmer. This effect is readily observable in large water bodies with relatively low levels of disturbance (lotic).
