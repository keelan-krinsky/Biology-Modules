# Water Conductivity
Conductivity is a measure of the ability of water to conduct electricity. Conductivity is measured in Siemens ($S$), and water conductivity is usually measured in Siemens per unit area, $\muS.cm^{-1}$ for low conductivity headland streams, for highly conductive $mS.cm^{-1}$. Conductivity must always be measured in conjunction with temperature as conductivity varies directly with temperature. Provided the temperature is recorded the reading can be standardized for comparison. 

>NOTE: Conductivity is the inverse of resistance

## Pollution Indicator
Conductivity is a good blanket measure of pollution especially in the case of metal (ion) pollution which significantly increases conductivity. However, some geologies naturally have more metals and therefore higher associated conductivity, so some variation is not necessarily indicative of contamination.
