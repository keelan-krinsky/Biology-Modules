# Waste Water Managment 

## __WWMMF: WasteWaterManagmentLegislativeFramework__

The greater part of south afirca is semiarid and subject to variabel rainfall, droughts floods nad high evaporation, only comparatvely narrow region along the eastern and southern coastline is moderately well watered whereas the greater part of the interionr is arid or semiarid, rainfall is poorly f\distributed relative to areas of experiencing economic growth. availabe freshwatrer resources in South Afric are already almost fully utilised and under stress. 

many indsutry plants will recycle their water on site and feed it straight back into industry. 

South Africa is estimated to lose as much as 40\% of its available bulk water as a result of non revenue water.
leaks alone due to poor infrastructure and mantinance account for 40\% of losses. 
there is also extreme pollution of surface and ground water. 


### NOn revenue water
water that is lost before it reaches the cosomer
billing errors, meter errors, theft, losses can be real loss through leaks, or apparent losses through theft or metering inaccuracies. 

### water use
growing manufacuting sector, incrased need for water by industies with additional industrail sector increases for tyh proposed number of themoelectric (COPY SLIDE)


### Water Use cycle and value chain, (COPY IMAGE),

#### Precipitation
lower pH than that ideal for drinking due to acid rain


##### As a consumptive use
water storage facilities to catch water, over a certain amount legal requirement to apply to muncipality.

#### Runoff
Run off into dams, which are usually on the mountains where the cleanest rainwater (least sediment is.)

#### Water treatment 
from the dams the water goes water treatment plants predominately floculation and coaggulation,
addion of only a few chemicals


#### Articulation system 
goes into houses where it is used, through its use waste water is generated. 

#### Industries 
metal pollution, acid mine drainage (high metal load).

>NOTE acid mine drainage will drain into the ground if simply disposed of, the WitsWatersrand is the biggest basin of acid mine drainage, 100s of years of rehabilitation will be required. (only a problem in the north as there are no mines in the south)



#### waste water treatment 
contains sewerage,and requires a lot more treatment. A final effluent, which should be clean enough is then discharged into the environment, into rivers, (and from there back into the dams)

### Importance
water loss leads to loss of livestock and crops. 

#### Impacts on industries
the impacts of water scarsity on industries, ubcrease cist abd decreased water security and supply as a direct result of decerasede water quantities, and decreased quality of water (sludge and potentail pathogens will be picked up from the bottom of dams/reservoirs), decreased ceterty of supply as a result of competing uses (with the Constitutional imperatuve of potable water as a basic right). Loss of jobs, and international trade.

### Constitution of South Africa 1996
within South Africa, the 1996 Constitution porivea the basis for defining the promotion of equity, equility adn COPY SLIDE 

### NEMA 
National environemental managment Amendment act 62 of 2008 

Governs the overall conservation and sustaiable utalisation of natural resources. 

focuses on, po;;ution prevention, envirnomental managment principles, indicent managment, environmental authorisations, administereed by Department of Environmental affairs. 

### Water policy and regulation environment 
the backdrop to all popitical andd development actrivity is the South African Constitution to which all law and public policy is subject 

In line with international trends and our national objective of managment of the nations resources, priority is given to a recieving water quality managment approach, (ie rivers, lakes and dams, catchment areas), as waste water is put into these


### Pre 1998 
before the promulation ofdthe NAtional Water Act water pollution cotrol laws were baseds on an approach best described as the solution to pollution is dillution

The degree of treatment required of a given industrila dishcarger depended on the assililatve cxapacity (COPY SLIDE) 

two major services had to be equallu distrivuted to alll southg africans COPY SLIDE> 


### NAtional water act of 1998 (NWA)
the act deals with issues such as,  protection using developing, consaerving managing and controlling of South afircvas watrer resources. 
the act COPY SLIDE) 


the highest priority was placed on the use of water for basic needs and environemtnal pruposes, (including surface and gorund water flows, required quanitity and quality of the flows set invcoversation with stake holders)

### Water services Act 1997
the right to access basic water supply and basic sanitation. administered by the department of water services adn sanitation, dealts with the setting og COPY SLIDE

### By Laws. 
By Laws apply more locally. An example is Chemical oxygen demand, some muncipalities have higher water use than others. Some industries genrate wateste with higher COD, especially industries such as breweries, industries get billed for their waste water, companies with very high COD like SAB may applyat their local mucipality for a relaxation. provided that a group of measured parameters comply with the limits specified in the amendments of the National Water Act (36/1998). Complies meas meeting the limits nmon compliace is exceeding the limit. (COPY IMAGE). high levels of ammonia causes asphixiation. 

the list of paramewters for wastye and drinking water differ. standards are used to prevent illegal dumping of polluted water. 

### monitoring. 
monitered on a weakly basis at least, checks for complaince and for leakage. COPY IMAGE, a monitoring program must be developed. quality assurance requirements. the site was identified before hand, 

monitoring sites must take into account safety, reprisentivity, variable selection. which paramters are are asses,who uses it ammoniam and PH for aquatic life, bacterial concentraions for human use frequency of sampling. routine sampling can be longer perionds specific incidents should have shorter sampling periods, 

grab sampling 
take scoop of water, only a snapshot, and not reprisentative of the whole site. 

Composite, sampling 
a number of grab samples are taken (and the mixed ) to givew the average over say the period of a day. 

### ISO quality systems 
quallity assusrance covers from sampling to waste water assesment.
