# Imports

# Water PH

## Influences

### Mining discharge
Acid mine drainage leads to very low PH.

### Acid rain
As raindrops fall they are about pH 7 butcomeintocontantwithmoreand more CO_@ decreaseing pH to 5

## Metal ion oxidation
Metal species oxidation state is directly dependant on pH.Some ionisation states are far more toxic/hazardous than others. 

>NOTE: Low PH will give water a metallic taste


## Effect on Aquatic life
Aquatic animals are very pH sensitive

### Fish
For fish a pH 6.5-9 is the optimum range.

### Algae
low PH tolerant algae form blooms,blocking out light, and using up oxygen, and ultimately killing most other organisms in the system.

# Alkalinity 
Alkalinity is ability to resist change in PH. 
Alkalinity can be increased by addition of buffers.
