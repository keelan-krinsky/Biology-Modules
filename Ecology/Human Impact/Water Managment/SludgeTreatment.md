# Sludge treatment 
75-90\% of solids of particles are mroemoved as primary sludge, and 50-75\% of organics settle out as primary sludge. entric microbe levels in primary stage COPY SLIDE. 

# secondar waste water treatment, sedimentation process occurs in which activated trickle filtration, settle out the biological solids producdd secondary sludege 90-99\% enteric micrbe pathogen reduction from the liquid phase, enteric microbe retention by the biological activity of solids, biodegradation of enteric microbes, proteolytic COPY SLIDE. 

Stabalised sludge, actively digesting sludge and 

sludge is pumped into liquid drying beds, wher it forms sludge cakes,very strong smell, so no longer reconmended for health reasons and environmental impact, equipment it used to press liquid out of the sludge, and evenutally burnt in anerobic digestors at very high temperatures to remove all of the pathogens. 

### Anaerobic digestion 
the goal is to reduce 


the soil like material generated can be mixed with different compounds and used as fertaliser, waste liquid from sludge treatments are recycled back into the process, the sludge is burntin a capped tank, to prevent oxygen from coming in and to capture the methane. the dried sludge is rich in nitrates, often mixed with phosphates to make fertaliser

####  Aerobic sludge digestion 
generates own heat

### Thermophillic 
faster due to higher heat.

#### Pathogen content
Sludge must be safe to use as fertaliser.

##### Class A 
less than one virus per 4 grams of dried solid sludge, less than. 
COPY from slides

produced using very high temperatures.
lime is added to stabalise the pH. pH is raised pH for 2 more hours, to prevent too acid fertaliser, and to prevent bacterial growth. 

## Dewatering system 
dewatering is the removal of water from sludge to thicken it and reduce its volume, typically only 1 percent solid volume, gravity thickenining can thicken up to ten eprcent, thickening centerfuge, gravity belt thickening can achieve up to 6\% thickening. mixed with polymer which flucuates sludge, flattened onto belt and goes through roles, as the sludge passes through the roller water is pressed out, (belt press).
