# Stream Slope 
The stream slope is the vertical drop along a horizontal distance, it measures how altitude changes along a stream from head waters to mouth. 

$SS=\frac{\text{elevation at contuor A}-\text{elevation at contour B}}{\text{length of stream between contours}}=\frac{\text{Vertical distance}{\text{Horizontal distance}}$

Stream slope is expressed in meters per kilometer, meters per 100 kilometers, or as a percentage or ratio.
