# South African River Distribution

## Rain fall related variation 
The annual precipitation rate decreasing moving from the east coast where it is around $1000-1200ml$ across to the west  coast where it goes as low as $100ml$ at the extreme. Evaporative potential is also far higher in the (north) west. In the combination of high rainfall will low evaporation allows for high run off a high water table, and the formation of perennial streams. Conversely, in the west, high evaporation and low rainfall result in  the formation of ephemeral rivers. Between these two extremes exists a band of intermediate conditions which allow for the formation of intermittent rivers.
