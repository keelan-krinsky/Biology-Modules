# River Longitudinal Trends

## Slope
The average slope (and altitude), trends to decrease moving down a river, as the first order streams of headwaters are  as usually in high altitude, mountainous regions. A significant exception to this trend is in the highveld in which the rivers drain a huge high altitude plateau. 


## Channel width
The channel width tends to increase moving down the river

## Discharge volume
The discharge volume tends to increases moving down the river, as streams join up combining their discharge. 

## Substrate size
Particle size of substrate, in particular bed substrate, tends to decrease moving down the river, essentially through the action of a filtering process.
