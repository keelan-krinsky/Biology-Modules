# River Longitudinal Divisions

## Upper Reaches 

### Hydrology 

### Physical conditions

#### Slope 
In general rivers have a very steep gradient by their source, with waterfalls in their upper streams.
 
#### Bed material 
The bed material in upper reaches is normally more rocky, and this combined with the shallow water depth frequently leads to the formation of ripples.

### Ecology 

#### Riparian zone
In almost all areas the riparian zone is heavily forested, with overhanding canopy with numerous branches extending over the river. 
 
## Lower Reaches/ Lowlands 

### Hydrology 

#### Flow rate
In the lower reaches the flow rate is very slow.

### Physical conditions

#### Turbidity 
Lowland rivers are generally very turbid, due do fine suspended particles

#### Bed material
Lowland rivers have a more uniform bed composition that headwater streams, consisting mainly of sand and silt.
