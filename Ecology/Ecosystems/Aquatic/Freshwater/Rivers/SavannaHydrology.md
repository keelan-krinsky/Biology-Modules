# Savanna Hydrology

### Catena 
A catena is a chain of soils linked by topography.

Soil moisture and nutrient concentration varies from hill tops to valley bottoms as a result of errosion, with higher moisure and nutrient concentration moving downwards. 

#### Formation 
Catena formation is driven by the natural processes of wind and water errosion, operating over thousands of years. (Catena formation is not associated with catestrophic flooding, so no alluvial deposits are formed. After hundereds and thousands of years have passed the landscape comes to eqillibrium with the rate of deposition matching the rate of errosion. 

#### Vegitation 
The Catena drives the types of vegitation found.

Baked ion/clay soils by the seepline block the infiltration of water, driven by hard rock materials. Broad leafed unpallatable trees grow on the hill tops with fine leag, pallatable trees in the velley bottoms, closely associated with the Raperian Zone. Variation within tree type is driven by interactions between the Catena and the raperian zone.
