# River Flow Accumulation

## Ephemeral
Ephemeral rivers are influent, i.e. they experience a new low of water by infiltration. Such rivers are characterised by porous bed material with very little water retention, and tend to dry out periodically. In some cases they may even be dry $\geq 90\%$ of the year, filling only after intense rainfall.

## Intermittent 
Intermittent rivers vary between influent and effluent, with a no net flow between the river water and the ground water, the amount of water in the river, and hence the flow rate and other related factors vary with time/season. In some instances, such as in the eastern cape they river may dry up completely in sections. 

## Perennial 
Perennial rivers are effluent, i.e there is a net inflow of ground water into the river, they are present through the year. 

## Artificial 
Artificial water channels occur in the form of wears, which land owners use to divert water from rivers to croplands or orchards.
