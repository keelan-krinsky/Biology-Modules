# River Branching Network
In general when classifying streams within a drainage network, a number is assigned to each stream to reflect the drainage area the channel dimensions and the discharge volume.

## Strahler method 
Numbers are assigned in a cumulative fashion based on the confluence of streams. A second order stream is characterised as forming from/lying directly below the junction of two first order streams, or the junction of a first order and a second order stream. A third order stream is formed from the junction of two second order streams and so forth. A stream must junction with another stream of equivalent order to result in the formation of a higher order stream, because otherwise there would not be a significant increase in the amount of water in the higher order stream forming the junction. These orders reflect the basic rules of drainage basin geometry.
