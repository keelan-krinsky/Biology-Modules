# River Zones
Generally speaking a river can be divided into three distinct zones, which graduate into each other, normally with not distinct borders. 

### Production Zone  
The production zone contains 1st-4th  order streams, and received water primarily from run off. As a result of the high levels of runoff bring with them a good deal of sediment. 

### Transfer zone
The transfer zone receives water predominately from upstream, and moves the majority of this water down stream, typically with no large exchange of water between the river and the terrestrial environment occurring. 

### Storage Zone. 
In the storage zone the flow of water is so slow that suspended substrate is alluviated in mass to form terrestrial environments, i.e. sandbanks/islands, within the water channel itself. 

### General trends 
there are several general trends when moving from the head waters downwards. 

 #. Bed material grain size progressively decreases. 
 #. Accumulated discharge increases. 
 #. Depth and width increases. (However the depth does not change much and always shows a large local variation.)

NOTE: Velocity does not significantly increase, as in any given section the ration of fast water to slow water remains relatively constant. 


#### Storage Zone. 
In the storage zone the flow of water is so slow that suspended substrate is alleviated en mass to form terrestrial environments (sandbanks/islands) within the water channel.
