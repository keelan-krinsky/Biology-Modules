# Suspended Solids

## Turbidity
The turbidity of a water body is the degree to which it absorbs/ blocks the passage of light. The more suspended solid particles there are in the water column, the greater its turbidity. 

## Source

### Landscape
Run off from the landscape is an important contributor of suspended solids. 

### River bed.
The river bed forms an additional source of solid material for suspension. 

## Effects.

>NOTE: (Vanishing waters by Dvies and Dae(?) is a good reference book for this section

### Shading
Increased turbidity can lead to shading of phytoplankton and macrophytes, leading to a decrease in photosynthesis based primary production. 

### Predation
Turbidity can reduce the ability of visual predators such as fish to hunt effectively. Additionally as there is less primary production there will be a corresponding decrease in primary and secondary (i.e predators) and higher levels of consumption. 

### Reproduction
Some Marco-invertebrates, such as Caddis flies require clean rock habits, especially for activities such as egg laying, blanketing of benthos by sediment removes their environment.
