# Riverine Food Webs

shredders feed on CP, and browsers feed on 

Planktonic communities are dominated by primary production, whereas in rivers the majority of the base material is dead organic material, hence grazers dominate waters and lakes, and Collectors dominate headwater streams. 

### Nutrient spiralling

consumers,
decomposers 
water column. 

there may be nodes, such as reeds, or carneleads (fly larvae), which trap nutrients, untiltil some disturbance pccurs. hence they flow of energy slows down and speeds up as it moves through the water column, adjacent wetlands can also act as nodes in the system. 

### Energy budgets/ nutrient budgets. 
Planktonic (lake) communities are primarily autochthronous, ie locally produced within the ecosystem. 

benthic stream communities end to be primarily allochthonous, (ie nutrinets are produced primarily outside the system and comming in. 

The source of much of the energy in the a stream comes from the terrestrial plant material. Macro-Invertibrate emmergance, terrestrial invertibrates rely on aquatic ecosystems for energy. terrestrial organisms are feeding on the subsidy coming from the terrestrial ecosystem. 

For example in the western united states of america, samon which swim up river get trapped in dams, to mantain the population hatcheries are raised and them dumed into the river when they get old enough, Mergansers a duck like bird prey on the samon smolts. 

When the smolts are dropped in Miganzers migrate to the stream, and then dispurse as the fish run out. , Mergansers exploit the free lunch.

### Rivers are four dimentional ecosystems.

### Longitudinal dimension 
Rivers dictated by abiotic conditions (shift from headwaters to lowland flood plains.

Additional trophic levels, potentially different feeding groups, Different nutrient flows, Nutrients can be transported upstream or downstream by anadromous (sea to river) or catadomous (river to seas) fish. Socae samon run. Samon become so adapted their mouth parts change to fight off other males to get to females but they are so adapted that they cannot eat food so they starve. HEnce they die forming piles of dead fish in the trees, which serves a a food source for grizzle bears, (which they require as a food source to build up fat reservwes for hibernation, bald eagles also rely heavily on the sammon runs. )

Eals in SA, live in stream but go out to sea to sporn and die. 

There are fundamental changes in the respiration going on between head water streams and lower down in the river, with consitent respiration, and production patern in the longitudinal organisation of the stream. 

In the riparian reaches there is alot of rithronic cover, which leads to shading so little energy in the form of light avaiable to aquatic plants and algae for photosynthesis, howvere there is lots of dead plant material from these terrestrial plants available of r herbivours, so the ration of energy by respiration : energy by primary production is greater than 1. 

Lower down these is more lgiht avialable, and more nutrients, in the form of dissolved particles, whcih leads to increased NEP from plants algae and diatoms, leading to more energy fixed by live organisms in phtosynthesis than the energy being processed by decomposers in the stream. 

On into the potamonic area of the river, where there is a higher susepnded load, some of the available light is blocked by the sediment, and the sandy substrate is not as good for benthic diatoms, or macrophytes, also as there is more accumulated biomater in the stream, there is increase in dead organic material,, so there is a switch back to increased energy proceeed by respiration comparted to photosynthesis. (in this case it is more the collectors than the grazers that are doing the bulk or the energy processing as they have more food available). 

The ratios of feeding groups changes moving longitudinally along the stream. at the head waters there are arge quantities of collectors , eating corse of finer organic material{?}. 

In the middle reachers there are more grazers, feeding on diatoms etc, 

in the lower reaches there are again collectors dominant, (especially those adapted to feeding on fine organic materia such as blood worms, )
in big rivers, bivalves are also present, feeding as filter feeders in the muddly waters. (require lage muddly systems, as where SA rivers go into limpopo. 

NOTE: all of this falls under the RCC river continum concept. 

### Problems. 
The concept is very broud so caution is required in its use. 

Firstly , functional feeding groups dp not allways translate across biogeographic zones. For, example stone fly preditors are found in upper and lower river, but others in a differnt family are grazers so are not found all the way along the river, this is a problem in SA where there is a huge variety of unknowned macroinvertibrates, there is limited capacity for insect taxonomy For example one common family is the betidee whch are extremely variety in their feeding morphology/biology, so the family level is not sufficeint for RCC. Many africa river systems such as the savanna system do not follow proposed model. 
assignment to feeding groups difficult

IN american there are tress out of pine forests, etc.

Most of the native trees do not form a canopy in SA, in amgalesburg the canopy cover is 80\% invasive.
poplar and seringa particularly are invasives which shead lots of leaves to the rive, in a pure savanna however.
