# Hydrological Components

## Dissolved inorganic nutrients
$PO_3^2-$ $NO_3^-$ are generally the most important dissolved inorganic nutrients to consider. Dissolved nutrient concentration forms an important limiting factor in biological growth and productivity. This concentration is normally increased dramatically in areas affected by human activity, i.e. near cities or industrial plants. 

## Dissolved organic nutrients. 
Tannins such as those that lead to the brown coca cola colored waters of western cape rivers are a form of dissolved organic nutrients. 
 
## Toxins 
Toxins may occur naturally in a system but are often related to human activities.  The most common toxins encountered are heavy metals and hydrocarbons (such as oil/fuel spills from cars).
