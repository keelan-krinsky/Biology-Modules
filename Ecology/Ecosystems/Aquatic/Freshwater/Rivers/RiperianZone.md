# Riperian Zone
A raperian gabitat is the area between the waters endge and the boundary where the water no longer influences the terrestrial environment. In upper water the raparian zone is very narrmow, but further down stream (in the storage zone) The raperian zone becomes very extensive, especially due to the formation of terrerial environments dirrectly in the water channel from alluviation. In the storage zone terraces, (which are ancestral flood plane deposits) surround the current flood plain deposit, in which the steam channel lies. Such areas are referred to as backstamps. Endorheic wetlands form around stream separated from it by berms, (alluvial) deposits. 

NOTE the presence of alluvial deposits (e.g. terraces and benches) adjacent to the active channel is a good indication of zone changes. 
(ise a third order is belw the junction of two second order streams.
These orders reflect the basic rules of drainage basin geometry.  
Firstly the average slope is decreasnig (normally) as first order are in moutnaous/high regions, a exception is the highveld which drains a huge high up plateu.
The channel width tends to increase wiith the
discharge volume increases . (as two streams are joining. )
Particle size of substrata decreases, (through a filtering porcess, )
