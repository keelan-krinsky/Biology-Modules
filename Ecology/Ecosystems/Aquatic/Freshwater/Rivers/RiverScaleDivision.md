# River Scale Divisions

### System 
A strech of river above a kilometer forms a system. 

### Segments 
Segments are rough $10^2m$ stretches of a system. Large Predatory Fish tend to move between segments at different stages of their life  cycle.

### Reaches 
Reaches are stretch of river of a $10^1m$ magnitude. 

### Riffles 
Rifles are stretches of river of a $10^0m$ magnitude. Different fish species tend to spend most of their time in different habitats.When the water level in the river is low the difference between environments is much more pronounced. More diverse flow conditions result in more habitats for macro-invertebrates. Deep pools in sequence with shallow rifles form vertical meanders.

#### Pool
Pools are deep and contain slow flowing water. In pools the base material tends to be fine sediment. 

#### Riffles 
Riffles are fast flowing and shallow containing turbulence created by the uneven bed. The base material in riffles tends to contain large rocks in sand. 

#### Runs 
The base material in runs tends to be gravel. 


### Microhabitats 
Microhabitats occur at a magnitude of $10^{-1}m$ magnitude. Insects live in specific habitats such as moss covered boulders, or sandy rock etc. 


#### Mesohabitats. 
Variation in channel profile leads to the development of distinct habitats, which can facilitate different species. For example catfish require shallow fast flowing waters (which have a high oxygen concentration), where as silver mouth sucker fish require additional depth.

#### Local variation 
Pools riffles and rubs are formed through a combination of hydraulic force and sediment size. 

from annual flow data collected over long periods can be used to give of long term climate patterns and stability as well as climate change. Monthly data reveals annual variation which is important in controlling biotic and abiotic processes in the river. For example changes in water flow rate can act as spawning triggers for fish 

With increase in mean annual run off coefficients of variation for flooding increases, That is, generally speaking arid zones have high variation in rainfall, and high rainfall zones tend to have low variation in rainfall. In south Africa in particular rainfall is very unpredictable. It follows that in around countries the need for water storage in increased, leading to many artificial lentic catchments (i.e dams). 


## Run
Such areas are reffered to as a run 

### Hydrograph 
Plots water flow against time, in a flood a rapid increase (rising limb) is seen floowed by a pea and a falling (hyperbolic) limp back to the baseline level. the peak incodes not only the flood water but also the normal baseline. Rain captured per unit time can alos be tracked and related. Ground water recession can reacharge/boost the water table raising it (ground water recession is the decrease of ground water back to its original level. , flooding recession is simple the dease in stream discharge. The size of the storm can be measured in terms of time. The center of mass of the rainstorm can be measure. The time between the heaviest rainfall and the peak detected by the wear is the basin lag. 
 The overall profile of the hydrograph can affect the flood responce. The profile of the landscape is also important. In a mountanous situation a sharper higher peak in flow will occur, whereas a plateu tends to have low sloping hydrograph. (This is becuase water is travelling faster donw the steeper gradient. )
 
 The shape of the gaging wier is also important, if there is more catchment closer than further away then the majority of the drained water is being drained closer to the wier (the majority of drainage density is close to wear), the peak will be sooner, conversely if the drainage density is concentrated further waay the peak will be lower. If there are two distinctive drainage areas one closer and on efurther there will be two peaks (a bimodal responce.) A higher drainage density leads to a higher peak. 
 
 In a tttrelliced catchment there is a much smaller area that can actually e drained leading to a lower hydrograph. 
 # BAnk lefull flodd
 Wilrl full up the entire bank fuulled area , occurs about every year. 
 
 ### Catostrophic 
 About every 50 years,the depth is twice as high, as the normal one. 

Lots of recently deposited material in the storage zone is an indication of a lot of flooding in the hydrology of the river. 

NOTE:o South Africa is a very ancient landscape, and so very stable with less obvious terraces. In newzeland however the land scape os very young geologically speaking, so more radical geological features surrounding rivers are present.

 Even if the geology around a river is not distonctive the vergitation around it will be, as there is a c;ear difference in composition and structure going up from the edge of the river up slope. (even when the slope is not particularly steep. There are thwo primary causes for this change, water availability and flood disturbance.

 #### Water availabili
 the water table is closer tp the surface closer to the river. 

 #### Flood disturbance 
 Strong floods can uproot grasses anf bushes but larger trees will be far more resistant to disturbance. Trees further back will be less resistant to flooding than those dirrectly in or along the river channel.

Futhermore due to the alluvial deposits the soil alongside the stream has a higher nutrient concentration. Soil quality in addition to water availbility helps to create the sharp distinction to between the terrestrial and riperian zone.
