# River Discharge
Discharge is the rate at which a volume of water flows past a given point. 

## Units
Discharge is measured in Cumecs ($m^3s^{-1}$)

## Measurement. 
To measure the discharge in a stream, the stream is divided horizontally into rectangular cells of an equal width. The depth at the start and end of each cell is then measured and the two value averaged to give an estimate of average depth. A flow device is then used to measure the velocity of the water moving through each cell. The sum of the discharge across all cells is the transect discharge. 

### Equation
$Q=\displaystlye\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_id_iv_i$

### Remote measurement
Discharge is often measured remotely with the use of gauging wears. Gauging wears temporarily stop the flow, measuring the height of the water which builds up behind the temporary obstruction, and the slight drop in stream height just in front of the barrier. This difference in height is then used to calculate the water velocity, using a, so a racing curve, which gives a standard relation between height and velocity. (basically a standard curve. Gauging wears are placed at strategic points across the catchment. A logger is used to record this flow data every hour or half hour for months, and all the collected data is stored until an engineer comes to retrieve it.

Discharge should be measured a bit before the wear as the wear retards the flow. Additionally riffles/rapids should be avoided as there is too much turbulence within them, a smooth deep laminar flow is best. This provides a more accurate measure of water volume. 

 > NOTE: in the Eastern cape gauging wear are only present on main dams, as all other gauging wears in this region were decommissioned in the 80s


§§§ Discharge. 
Dishcarge is the rate at which a volume of water flows pst a pomt over a unit of time. 

$Q=m^3s^{-1}$
NOTE: $m^3s^{-1}$ are reffered to as cumecs (?) 

#### Measurement. 
See in back of prac handout one 

The stream is divided into equal width rectangular cells vertically downwards. 
The width and the depth of each cell will be measured. (the depth at the start and end of each cell is measured and averaged). A flow device is then used to             measure the vvelocity of the water going through each cell. The sum of the discharge across all cells is the transect discharge. 

$Q=\displaystlye\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_id_iv_i$

Dishcarge is often ,easured remotely with the use of gagine wears, which temporariily stop the flow and thenmeasure the height of the stream. Such wears are places 
at strategic ponyts across the catchment. 

(eatern cape only on main dams, as others decomissioned in the 80s
 
A logger logs the flow depth for every hour or half hour for months, and then the data will be retrieved by an engineer. However the data is only height , so a          racing curve, which has a relation of measures of height and discharge. (basically a standard curve. ))Discharge should be measured a bit before the wear as the         wear retards the flwo, also in a riffle/rapid there is too much turbulance, so a smooth depp laminar flow is best.

NOTE: the volume is the same thrtought but some areas are more accurate to measure.
