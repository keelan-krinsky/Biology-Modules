# River Continuum Concept

##t## Longitidinal
Increasing influence of fluvianl forms (i.e. terraces.)

#### Transeverse. 
There is a lateral decrease in fluvial depositis moving uphill from the river. 

#### Combined affect. 
In the hills, by the streams headwaters there are no alluvial deposits (sediment is removed from this zone not diposited), so no real physical heterogenaity exists, there is no obvious Raperian zone and only terrestrial life forms, i.e. broad leafed trees are present. 

Lower down, by the valley bottom, alluvaial deposits are present as well as backswamps and berms. Additional there is enough space now for a Catena gradeint to develop leading down towards the river, which in conjunction lead to much greater variation between the Raperian and terrestrial zones.


## LAteral dimension 
There is both active and passive movement of organisms from the riparian zone to the river, (including reparian wetlands. 

Moviment from the river into the riperian zone. ). The moviment of macroinvertibrates (insects) in and out of the river in thier life cycle (larvae vs adults) constitutes active moviment/ nutrient cycling, there is also passive transfers. 

Flooding drives biotic composition of the riparian zone river channel morphology. temperature distribution of allochthonous material. (temperauter is affected as ground water moves up, (presumable regulates temperature more stricktly. )). 

## Vertical 
Many organisms move actively between the benthos and the hyporheos, to utilise resources, and avoid disturbance.

Communities within unconfined alluvial aquifers are poorly understood, as the aquifer can potentiall range far from the river chaneel (2km) and can be several meters down. 

Well drilled (2km from the stream), larvae startced hatching out.  Ground water can serve as a source of dissolved organic nutrinets particularly N and P compounds that support primary production at upwelling zones in the river, active transport such as animals burrowing down and comming out also occurs between the two systems. 

## Temporal 

Can occur at various different time scales. 

### Lotic ecosystems experience environmetnal change over period of day (diurnal , yearly (seasonal), decades centuaries etc. 

#### Diurnal 
temperature, light intensity, oxygen concentration in the water. 

#### Seasonal 
Drives fish spawning 


which sacle to use,depends on the organism and the process under study, for example phtosynthesis is diurnal and well as seasonally dependant. seasonal vs catastrophic flooding in Mpumalanga is a;sp an important example where scale must be considered. 

FOr example one in a hundered year flood wiped out entire riparian zone, which can massively resetthe ecosystem. In general the scale of the impapct is generall related to the time between impact events. 
within a year a microhabitat will change. 
habitats such as the arrangment of trees in the riparian zone will be over several years eg with flooding patterns. 
an entire secrtore could change every few decades. and an entrie flood plain would change more in the order of thousands of years, an entire drainage basin drains on the order of hunders of thousands of years. 


Rivers are highly interactive with surrounding ecosystems, both laterally and vertically. SEveral theories exist to explains aspects of these re;ationships, but each must be considered in context, (ie european is similar to invasive dominated SA system with forest in headwaters, but in classical SA open headwater RCC not very well followed. )

A spatio-tempral perspective of rivers allows us to understand how humans distrupt these processes. 
(Critical to understand what we 'should see') to work on managment processes.
