# River Scale Divisions

### System
A strech of river above a kilometer forms a system. 

### Segments
Segments are rough $10^2m$ stretches of a system. Large Predatory Fish tend to move between segments at different stages of their life  cycle.

### Reaches
Reaches are stretch of river of a $10^1m$ magnitude. 

### Riffles
Rifles are stretches of river of a $10^0m$ magnitude. Different fish species tend to spend most of their time in different habitats.When the water level in the river is low the difference between environments is much more pronounced. More diverse flow conditions result in more habitats for macro-invertebrates. Deep pools in sequence with shallow rifles form vertical meanders.

#### Pool
Pools are deep and contain slow flowing water. In pools the base material tends to be fine sediment. 

#### Riffles
Riffles are fast flowing and shallow containing turbulence created by the uneven bed. The base material in riffles tends to contain large rocks in sand. 

#### Runs
The base material in runs tends to be gravel. 


### Microhabitats
Microhabitats occur at a magnitude of $10^{-1}m$ magnitude. Insects live in specific habitats such as moss covered boulders, or sandy rock etc. 

### raperian Habitats
A raperian gabitat is the area between the waters endge and the boundary where the water no longer influences the terrestrial environment. In upper water the raparian zone is very narrmow, but further down stream (in the storage zone) The raperian zone becomes very extensive, especially due to the formation of terrerial environments dirrectly in the water channel from alluviation. In the storage zone terraces, (which are ancestral flood plane deposits) surround the current flood plain deposit, in which the steam channel lies. Such areas are referred to as backstamps. Endorheic wetlands form around stream separated from it by berms, (alluvial) deposits. 

NOTE the presence of alluvial deposits (e.g. terraces and benches) adjacent to the active channel is a good indication of zone changes. 
(ise a third order is belw the junction of two second order streams.
These orders reflect the basic rules of drainage basin geometry.  
Firstly the average slope is decreasnig (normally) as first order are in moutnaous/high regions, a exception is the highveld which drains a huge high up plateu.
The channel width tends to increase wiith the
discharge volume increases . (as two streams are joining. )
Particle size of substrata decreases, (through a filtering porcess, )

§§§ Discharge. 
Dishcarge is the rate at which a volume of water flows pst a pomt over a unit of time. 

$Q=m^3s^{-1}$
NOTE: $m^3s^{-1}$ are reffered to as cumecs (?) 

#### Measurement.
See in back of prac handout one 

The stream is divided into equal width rectangular cells vertically downwards. 
The width and the depth of each cell will be measured. (the depth at the start and end of each cell is measured and averaged). A flow device is then used to             measure the vvelocity of the water going through each cell. The sum of the discharge across all cells is the transect discharge. 

$Q=\displaystlye\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_id_iv_i$

Dishcarge is often ,easured remotely with the use of gagine wears, which temporariily stop the flow and thenmeasure the height of the stream. Such wears are places 
at strategic ponyts across the catchment. 

(eatern cape only on main dams, as others decomissioned in the 80s
 
A logger logs the flow depth for every hour or half hour for months, and then the data will be retrieved by an engineer. However the data is only height , so a          racing curve, which has a relation of measures of height and discharge. (basically a standard curve. ))Discharge should be measured a bit before the wear as the         wear retards the flwo, also in a riffle/rapid there is too much turbulance, so a smooth depp laminar flow is best.

NOTE: the volume is the same thrtought but some areas are more accurate to measure.
