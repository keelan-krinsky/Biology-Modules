# Wetland Taxonomy

## Exorheic 
In an exorheic wetland, water flows through the wetlands and off into an adjacent water body. In many such wetlands water will flow into the wetland from an adjacent stream and then from the wetland back into the same stream, slightly further downstream.

### Endorheic 
In Endorheic wetland, water flows into the wetland from the surroundings but once in  the wetland has nowhere to flow off too, dissipating only by evaporation or infiltration. Endorheic wetlands are low points in the landscape which receive most of their water in the from of runoff. As a result sediment accumulates in these wetlands, and high concentrations of soluble substances such as salt are also accumulated.
