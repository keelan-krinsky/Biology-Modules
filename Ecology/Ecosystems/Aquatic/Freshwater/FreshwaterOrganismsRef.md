## Diversity of freshwater organisms.
## Biodiversity
Biodiveristy can be considered at a number of different levels, some important measures of diversity to consider are: 

 #. Species richness.
 #. Relative abundance.
 #. habitat diversity 
 #. genetic diversity. 
 #. Behavioural diversity. 

 In short biodiverity is everything which contributes to variation/variety within a ecosystem

### Species diversity
Species diveristy can be evalutated in different terms. 

#### Species richness.
Species richmess is simply a measure of the number of distinct species within a given ecosystem/area. 

#### Endemism.
Endemism is a measure of how spacially restricted somed species are. A ecosystem with a high number of organisms restricted to it will have a high endemism and so will  be important with respect to conservation biology. 

### Marrine systems.
Marrine system tend to be more diverse in regard to higher taxa (i.e. classes and orderes as a pose to species), which means they are, in some regard at least more diverse. For example seas contain many differnt phyla, such as echinoderms, jayfish, and authropodds. 

### Drivers.
The patterns seen in biodiversity are driven by biological processes, (operating at different size and time scales. ) Organisms are adapted to the condition in which they live and the resources avaiable to them, which consitutes their fundamental niche. A organism can only survive in a limitted range of variations around this niche. The morphology, behaviour, and life history of an organism is reflect its adaptions to its environment, and also the adaptions of its ancestors. 

For example, The mayfly, has over millions of years develped a effecient body shape. the phylogeny refelcts the modern morphology. Habitat range and currentl geographical ditributaion are reflections of historical events and environmental constraints and opotunities. 

### Fresh water organisms.
Early evolution of all major phyla occured in the sea. Most phylla evolved in the cambrain explosion (which was an exclusively marrine event). 

### Colonisation of land and freshwater.

#### Dirrect upstream
Some animals entered freshwater from the marrine environment dirrectly by swipping upstream from esturies. Prosobranch snails (snails with a gill) plathyelminths, ologocheate, and crustaceans are examples thereof. 

#### Through terrestrial
Some animals first entered the land and addapted to terrestrial living before later on adaption to a freshwater environment. Insects, flowering plants (actually evolved on land full stop), lunged snails, birds, mammals and reptiles are examples there of. 

NOTE: there organisms often do not live perminantly in the water using it primarily just to feed. 

#### Moviment in ice
Movement of ice over the surface of the land, in the northern hemishpere during the ice ages, folled by the formation of lakes as the ice receeded could have isolated organisms is the newly formed salt water lakes which later become freshwater. 

NOTE: Insects have not re-entered the sea, but have entered freshwater environments, for several reasons:
 #. There are many other authropods (crustaceans such as decapods/shrimp))already filling the niches which insects would fill, so the competition would be intense. 
 #. Insects reproductive strategy involves egg laying, and eggs would get damaged in rocky shore of stormy sea environments. 
 #. Insects live partly on land, which is difficult in the middle of the ocean. 

All in all after terrestrial adaptation the marrine environment proved too hostile and compeditive, the freshwater did not. 

## Plate techtonics.
Plate techtonics is well decribed since the Permean period, 286mya. The terrestrial world was all goined to from one large landmass, Pangea at this point, surrounded by the oceans. 

Pangea broke up just north of the equator to form Lurasia and Gondwana land, and the tethys sea was formed. Critically this change lead to a change in hwo water flowwed from the north to the south poles, and a change in migratory patters, which lead to the splitting of phylogenies. 

## Vaceriance.
Vacarinence is the formation of new species by the imposition of a physical barrier which lead to reproducive isolation of differnt populations of the species. 

For example, the genetic phylogeny of Chiroomids, (non biting midges) which are very abundant in freshwater systems can be used to track the continental rearrangmenr. 
 
 #. South africa split from antartica. 
 #. new zeeland slipt from antartica. 
 #. Australian and east antartica split off from south america and west antartica. 
 
 NOTE: the relatively shallow divergence between Africa and Lurasia is explaned by the fact that theses continents crashed into eachother again laer on, at which point chiomoods species again mixed and interbred. 

## Climate change
Climate change can change the shape and extent of dryland, primarily through changing seas levels. Climate change occurs at different rates in different peridos, it has occurred at a relatively rapid rate for the last 30 million years. 

### River capture.
Due to fluctuations in geographic shape and sea level, river patterns can change. 
In the early plastocease the whole of the aguleus bank was drained by the old fish river which flowwed over namibia. Th organhe river connected to the olifancts and entered the sean west of langerbaan. Then the sea levels rose and the orange river changed its course capturing the fish river. Vacarience then occured in the Olifants and Orange rivers. 

For example catfish, Austroglonidid. evolded in the ancinet orange/ olifants system, In the modern Olifants an alleopathic species arose endemic to the Orange (orange/vall catfish), and one endemic to the Olifants (clanwilliams catfish)

### Great lakes.
In Africa the great lakes, Victorial, Malawe, and Tangnyito show very high levels of diversity. 

COPY diagram 

In particular there is high diversity in chiclids in Lake Malawe. Many different species f chiclid are present, differentaied predominatel by mouth shape. For example there are, scael eaters, eye bites mullosuc crushes, vegitation eaters, etc. Chiclids from the sub family Haplochromine are the root othe the diversity. This diveristy is facillitated by the short generation times of such fish, as well as maternal brooding (where the eggs, and even sometimes the young fish are brooded in the mother's mouth, or nest gaurding (usually  by the father.), Becuase of this reporductive behaviour different species do not intermix. The basic adaptable body plan of the fish allows it to ocupy any given general niche, and its mouth parts can be optimised to avoid competition within this general niche. 

The phsyical drivers of speciation in this case, could be classic alleopathic specieation in rivers followed by colonisation of the lakes or more porbably micrographic speciation within the lakes themselves, dirven by changes in lake levels leading to isolation of groups for periods long enough for speciation to occur. (the time required is shortened considerable by the specific morphological and behavioural adaptions of these fish)

NOTE: river capture occurs when a river changes its course and flows into anther river. 

### History
In was long oberved by scientists that South america fit rather neetly into Africa, and based on this the theory of continental drift was proposed. However it was not until after WW2 that any mainstream credence was given to this theory. in WW2 antisubmarine sonar technology was developed, which was later used to map out the ocean floor. Large ridges along the ocean floor were discovered

COPY IMAGE. 

These ridges were caused by magma from the center of the earth swelling up, and cooling forming new rock in the process and pushing the old rock asside to make way, which has the effect of pushing the contintents further apart. Continents can also be brough together if two plates meet and one slodes under the other. 


#### True Dirrect
A very small number of organisms may have evolved dirreclty in freshwater systems.  


## Organising understanding of diversity

there are differetn scales to understand diversity

#### Ethiopian

##### Fauna
Species that evoleved within the continent afrer the split from Pangea. in addition to fauna that entered from the north, after the closing of hte Tethys Sea. 
Oriental. COnsits of two components the southe temperate Gondawanian forms and the Pan-Ethiopian forms. 

###### South temperature Gondawanian
Found on the tip of africa but also in antartical and mnay other regions, (they are all found within specific distance from the equator. 
Today theses animals are restricted to cooler mountanous areas, normally restricted to waterbodies which remain cool all year round. SSuch animals are ofter Stenotherms, toerate very low temperatures range with a very low maximum temperature at which they can survive. 

Relict families shared among southern Gondwanan regions like New Zealand e.g. Corydalidae. (dobsonflies), such animals used to be far more widespread but are now marginalised. 

###### Pan Ethiopian fauna
Evolved in the northern part of africa when it was moving throuhg the tropical region. they form the bulk of african fauna related to tropical african biota. 
this group is further divided into 
 #. the original tropical Gondwanaland (tropical Gondwanian forms)
 #.those that entered Africa after the Tethys Sea Closed. 
 

NOTE: As africa moved north in the split up from Pangea, the cold temperate regions became tropical, so animals moved south to stay within their fundamental niche. leading to many extinctions.

### Continental
biogeographic subregions 

### Regional
ecoregions , the current constraints animals face. 

There are 31 recognised/categorised aquatic ecoregions in South africa. theses regions are based on topography rainfall and geology. The rivers have similar physco-chemical features and thuse similar biota (as biota have the smae constraints. 

For example in the waterburg there is subbtropical climate, low nutrient clear water flowing of the mountain. 

In the northern excaspment there is a mixture of sedimentary ignious rock, so higher natureal nutrient content, lower climate, with a mix of subtropical and tempaerate climatae. 

 Low filed 
 high accumulated sediment, and nutrient levels, high temperature as subtropical and low donw.

 western floded montains 
 low nutrient clear streams low termbidity, but in mediteranian climate, cold wet winter. )

### Catchment
zones and habitat types, Tranferable across all ecoregions to a large extent. 
IN lotic ecosystems , faunal communities occur in two zones 

#### rhithron
mountain streams and rivers 
1st second and sometimes 3rth order streams 

#### potamon
big lowland streams/rivers. 
3rd 4th 5th etc  however the division between rithric and potamic communities is not static or consistent. 

COPY IMAGE> 
zoning in europian rivers. 
The potamonic zone is split into an upper (epi potamon) and lower section (meta-potamon). Note more turbulent water to calmer, decrease in sediment size, more macrophyte growth, (IN SA too much turbidity for large macrophyte growth). Forested head streams with grassland low rivers, in SA however headwaters may not be forseest, bu grassland or savannah rather. Flooding is more violent in the smaller streams than in the bigger streams, and there are more aquatic preditors down stream (as the habitats are larger) in the headwaters, with smaller habitatis there are more terrestrial preditors. Europenas call the Rhithron the Troat zone , the Eip-P the Barbel zone and the meta-potamon the Bream zone. Trout is a stelotherm so can only survive in cold well oxygenated water so must be in head waters. 
In the lower waters animals can live in warmer waters but require rocky substrate to form on, such as the american small mouth bass. In the lowland the european carp, eats mud/mud siffter, and lays eggs on aquatic macrophytes. .  In south africa the equivalent up water fish is the meloty minnow, whihc is a gondwanian fish, (trout is stocked in large regoins and must share restircted habitat , also trout feed on these minnows, (the minnows are insectivors only)). Lower down,orange river catfish in the middle,   the large mouth yellow fish is only found in big open waters, and lare large  piscivours. 

### Zonation in lentic comunities.

#### Pelagic
organism found in open water (oceans + lakes. 

##### Plankton
passively moving 

##### Nekton
actively moving. 

##### Limnetic
shallow pelagic, still light 

##### profundal zone
very little light. 

This zoning holds true for lentic ecosystems and in areas of low flow in rivers. which are sufficiently deep and large. 


#### Benthic

##### Benthos.

#### literal/shoreline,
close to the edge of water bodies.  

#### Neuston
surface of the water and just below it 

there will be different proportions of these communities in different water bodies, i.e. the size and shape of the water body determies the extent of habitaits available. 

For example in lake geriep there will be a large pelagic zone as it is depp and wide. or in a wetland there will be, literal dominated or in a larger wetland possible bethic dominanted.

## Organimms living on the epineuston or under the hyponeuston water surface.

Thin organic film, trapped by surface tension, which can provide a food source. 
Epineuston: hemiperterans, coleopteranns. 

Worly gig beetle, sits in surface tension, half body above half belw, eyes above to hung eyes below to see and avoid fish. Hyponeuston example would be a mosquito larva whcih essentially havew  snorkel, which protrudes out of the water, theey are also very vulnerable to fish. Some microorganisms such as rotifers, protozonas and codepis make up the microfauna in the hyperoes, whihc is an interstitial water among particles at the bottom of river channel, or lake bottom. Fauna comporises mostly copepods, rotifers, protozons. 

can be a perminant habitat or a temperary refuge, such as burrowing fish in newzealand river. Energy budgets and Food webs, 


## Special adatations of aquatic animals in freshwater

### Regulation

#### Osmo-regulation.
Freshwater environments are less saline than the bodies of aquatic organisms 

##### Freshwater.
##### Skin exchange.

In fresh water an osmoregulating fish takes up water through its skin, and actively takes up ions through its gills, It drinks little water , and excretes dilutes urine 

COPY IMAGE. 

#### Salt water
In salt water an osmoregulating fish loses water though its skin, drinks ample water, excretes ions through gills, and excretes concentrated urine. 

##### Skin exchange
looses water passively through skin due to osmotic pressure. 

##### Urrination
excretes concentrated urine. 
NOTE: Salmon can osmoregulate in both environments. 

#### Physiological mechanisms
Reabsorbance of salts. 
Active ion uptake. 

#### Energy consequences
There may be an energetic cost of osmoregulation which drives smaller size in freshwater streams. (for example crayfish, although there are other explanations, such as greater food availability, there is more detritus available in marine environments. ).

#### Thermoregulation
water tends to be thermally stable (especially in systems with a well developed thermocline. This means that most aquatic organisms can afford to be poikilothermic. (there body temperature is allowed to adjust passively to that of the outside environment. ). Such animals tend to be uni-therms, ie they are adapted to a wide range of different temperatures. 
This is achieved through temperature compensation, there are both metabolic and behavioral techniques for maintaining body temperature. 


#### Respiration
Maximize surface area of respiratory tissue, and maximize the rate of flow of oxygenated water , (while minimizing the surface area though which they can loose / gain unwanted water  or salts which disrupts their osmotic balance.). This leads to a conflict between respiration and osmoregulation, where an optimum must be reached. Most animals are adapted to deal with this problem with gills, which differ in shape and surface area depending on the particular environment of the given organism (species). for animals in less oxygenated water  The gill is either a big leaf shape or consists of multiple strands, 
For Baetidae and Heptageniidae which live in fast flowing oxygenated water the gill is more streamlined, and a bit smaller. Plecopteran , ventilate their gills by flapping their legs to increase current. 

In dragon fly larvae a rectal gill is used, which allows for propulsion by sucking in and pushing out water. 
Some insects have normal insect spiracles, such insects developed adaptions such as a "breathing tank" in beetles with a substrate cavity, above the trachea. Bugs tend to use a with plastron hairs which trap air bubbles. some others such as mosquito larvae use what is essentially a snorkel 

### Mantenance of position in lotic waters.
the current can often be extremely strong, this can be dealt with by 

##### aviodane behaviour
moving during floods, and in general living in sheltered areas such as behind boulders, 
Body shape which is streamlined helps as well as attachment morphological features for gripping onto the substrate. 

##### Body shape
the heptageniid mayflies are extremely adapted so that they can live and feed on the surface of the rock surface, this body shape means the current pushes the insect down onto the rock, the tail is used as a rudder to steer the mayfly. 
Claws (mayflies suckers (Blepharacerideae simuliidae, or a silk cord which they attatch and can climb back up if they happen to fall off the rock.  silk nets, (hydropsychids, muscular foot, gastropods. )))

#### Lentic waters.
As there is not flow for passive movement, active movement is required, however animals such as plankton still require at least vertical movement for example to stay on the right side of the thermocline. 

Fish maintain there buoyancy with a swim bladder, an organic attached near the top of the spine, 
Algae have trapped gas/oil bubbles, water hyacinth have lacunae (large air filled structures within the stem. 

### Migration
There is a lot of migration occurring in the vertical direction, it is still an active process, exhibited by most pelagic plankton species, generally they are in deep water in the day moving up to shallower water at night (migrating at dusk). 

Predators avoidance during the day, such as from fish, and other visual hunting predators, 
energy conservation , stay warm enough that metabolism is working without using energy to cool down, move up at night to feed on phytoplankton. 

NOTE: still don't want to be below thermocline as their is low oxygen 
(in summary, find food, don't becomes food, and regulate metabolism). 

There are predators within the phytoplankton which tend to follow their prey, such as (?) which follow copepods.

#### rivers.

##### Drift.
downstream transport by the current of benthic animals. It is a voluntary behavioral adaptation. 

###### CAtastrophic
animals which are involved in catastrophic, unpredictable disturbance. 

###### Behavioural drift.
individual organisms or small groups or organisms which all move into the water column due to a particular stimulus, ie to avoid predation or to find food. Active decision made based on a common driver in the background habitat. 
Escaping from a local stress, abandonment of a substrate. drift is a very energy efficient way of moving around (compared to using muscle contractions to move along the stone. avoid attach from a predator. Generally higher at night. trout make drift dangerous as they sit by an area of low flow next to an area of high flow and eat stuff coming down the high flow area, trout are visual predators so more dangerous in the day. 

NOTE: catastrophic drift is orders of magnitude higher than the normal level of drift seen. 

For example in the rotenone drift animals let go on mass even beatles which using their own air to breath were not yet affected, but could still smell the posion. 

###### Advantages of drift.
Works in ballance with tendancy in adults to fly upstream. which in combination drives dispersal. which helps to mediate competition for food and space. Drift can allow for rapid recolonization after a disturbance event such as a flood. provided there is an upstream refuge area. (post flood drift. ). 

### Re[roduction and dispersal
both sexual and asexual reproduction is seen in freshwater systems. 
In certain situations asexual reproduction is very useful as it is very rapid, has low energy cost and can easily be used to take advantage of friendly areas such as temporary ponds. (which have lots of food an d no predators. ). the disadvantages are low or no genetic variation which leads to vulnerability to population crashes and extinctions. most can do both, organisms switching to sexual production when the environment starts to change.for example males produced as stream dries up so that genetic variation in eggs produced just before the whole pond dries.  

###### Cosnant
animals which let go by accident or which just generally drift. 


## Type of fertilisation
Overall sexual reproduction is much more widely found than asexual reproduction 

### Broadcast spawning
the gametes are put directly into the water column, and form zygotes, basically for sessile animals. 

for mobile animals there is more active fertilization, often in a spawning bed, in the case of salmon female makes a Redd,  a space to lay eggs, male fertilizes eggs as they are released, this is external but localized. 

In insects there can be internal fertilization. 

In freshwater organisms ranges from broadcast spawning through to internal fertilization. A large portion of marine invertebrates are sessile so rely on the water column for mixing and dispersal, this is possible in the sea because there are a lot of strong currents allowing for mixing of gametes and dispersion of offspring to new areas. 

not so much broadcast spawning in rivers and lakes. 
In lakes because there is very little current. wind reach can lead to mixing but still far less than that induced by wave action and ocean currents. In rivers gametes only move downstream so things don't necessarily mix properly, (ie is males produce before females all sperm are gone downstream before eggs arrive. this spawning mechanism is optimized for rocky shores. 

## Spawning aggregations.
strongly linked to season, temperature and flow. (selecting parts of the habitat which are ideal for incubating eggs))
female finds good bolder releases pheromone all males in the water come behind he, lays eggs in small bunches which stick to rocks, males all pile in to try and lay release their sperm. some males come right up to touch the females, ignore other things in their environment. scavengers will try and eat loose eggs which come past in the water column. In a big spawning aggregation individual chances of being picked off by a predators are lower. 

Competition for successful copulation / fertilization 
mating territories (e.g. odonates) defend /competed for by males, females entering this territory will be courted. the male who mates with the female last is most likely to pass on his genetic information. engage in mate guarding, male hangs onto female to prevent her from mating with other females. mating aggregations in insects also occur, which are characterized by synchronized appearance and swarming. many groups emerge on mass most classically mayflies. Some mayflies live only 24 hours as adults, so emerge mate and die. mating aggregations tend to focus around land marks for example caddis flies around a particular tree. mating swarms maximizes the opportunity for all different organisms to find a mate. generally all males, deceases interspecies competition, ensures constant between sexes. territories vs aggregation is to an extent species vs individual. leads to high increased predator attraction but still overall risk of individual predation risk is decreased. 

Dispersal of eggs tends to be done upstream of of eggs spawning sites. In the case of freshwater systems eggs are generally laid on rocks, sometimes vegetation, in lentic systems there are not many rocks so eggs are normally laid on marcophytes at the edge of the stream, or on rafts which float on the surface of the water. 

Overall reproductive strategy 
r vs k selection 

## R selection
many small, insects. In general r selection is most common in fish insects and crustaceans for freshwater systems, generally more eggs/young produced by planktonic forms than macro-invertebrates, which tend to lay small batches, several batches in different places but still overall less eggs. 

## K selection
fewer larger eggs. cylincoid fishes from lake Malawi, mouth brooders <100 about 20, eggs at a time.  

### Population dynamics of the system.
Organisms compete among each other and with other specie for limited resources. When there are plentiful resources there is rapid increase in population size. A mismatch between resources and consumers will result in population losses through one of two routes. mortality and dispersal. the number of fish in a given region of stream may fluctuate, and increasing because of increased resources, and then dropping because of dying of movement to avoid competition. 
COPY IMAGE. 

the overall birthrate in the population will decline as resources decline, one birthrate and mortality are equal a balancing point is reached which is the carrying capacity of a particular habitat. Intraspecific competition for stable limited resources means populations will be kept below a stable threshold maximum. 
depending on the rate of resource distribution change die offs and increases may be more for less dramatic, emerging adult black flies disperse at higher rate id the local population density of larvae is too high. COPY IMAGE>  such dispersal patterns are found in fish as well as in macroinvertibrates, fish however because of their size have a lot more requirements in terms of ideal environments for spawning, (COPY IMAGE). For example in particular season water temperature, fall to the right range and all fish moved up to particular places along the river, larvae drift down stream to go into shallow backwaters, safe from predators, but with lots of food. 

overwintering, rivers free over, so fish must find thermal refuges in the winter, in SA fish will find optimum habitats for feeding and for predation risk, daily or seasonal migration between refuge and feeding habitat occurs in a single reach. In ephemeral, or temporal rivers, source sink dynamics are seen, for a serious of pools in an intermittent stream, fish move between refuge pools and pools which dry up in dry season, so constant reshuffling, reproduction and overwintering in resource habitats. refuge habitats would change from year to year. so fish reorganize depending on the season and water . temporary habitats are sinks as they do not have the possibility to sustain a fish for a long time, so there is a movement between source and sink habitats. expand from permanently wetted refuges into temporarily wetted sink habitats. fish populations in temporary systems are a good indication of expand (resources in the source pools will fluctuate with varying population levels). 

### Adapting to life without water
many lentic and lotic environments are naturally episodic or intermittent nonetheless aquatic organisms still thrive in these systems, and adapt by evolving resistance to desiccation and/or resilience to habitat loss. 

there are many temporarily which can form cysts, such as fairy shrimp, the eggs are resistance to desiccation not the adults. flexible reproductive strategy, resistant cysts or eggs, resistant immature /adult stages (low metabolic state, moist membrane ). escape by flight (insects which flying adults)/ burrowing (hand out in the ground water, such as certain species of talapia. ). rapid re-colonization (resilience ) 

Wet phases can also be harsh, such as catastrophic flood, use hypoheos, during floods. burrowing can be used to survive both drying out and flooding. burrowing into the hyperheos. Lungs fish is extremely drought resistant. As the water level falls lungfish burrow into the bottom nu to form a cocoon and aestivate through the dry season. eastivating as an adult is an extreme drought resistance adaptation. Killifish tend to live in temporary ponds, lay drought resistance eggs or cysts in sediment of drying ponds, which hatch when water returns Killifish (_Northobranchius_) lay aestivating eggs. 

## animal ecology in fresh water systems.
competition and adaptation, aquatic organisms vary in their abilities to self regulate and survive environmental variability.  This variable adaptation among species have different strategies to cope with environment predators, and competitors. because of theses varying adaptations and strategies there are specific environmental conditions in which a species is able to sustain a population which is known as a niche. 


### Fundamental niche.
the full potential set of environmental conditions a species could survive in, given no competition. however all organisms have to compete with other similar organism so the loser o the competition get shrunk into a smaller subset ie the realized niche, 
 
### Realised Niche.
the actual sub-set of these environmental conditions in which the species is observed to survive, given real levels of competition with other species. 

shifts between fundamental niches happen on evolutionary time scales. for example two groups of sticklebacks in the Columbia glacial lakes. during the last ice age there were expansions and contractions which moved lakes and rivers, driving potential speciation, hence there were multiple invasions of lakes by sticklebacks (which are river fish). subsequent invaders had to compete with the sticklebacks already there, overtime theses groups shifted their fundamental niches away from each other overtime evolved a limnetic form , and a benthic form shifts in fundamnetal physiological biology, such as number of gill rakers in the body (note when there are two species the range of physiological characteristics of each are confined to a smaller  )range, longer gill rakers in limnetic fish feeding on plankton. the most extreme example of speciation and niche differentiation is the Malawi fish. (cillonlids.)
 
### Community as a whole
disturbance in structuring freshwater communities, community structure can be described as being controlled by two interacting forces. 

competition and disturbance, if competition dominates community structure., such as lakes like Malawi of British Columbia, the community i deterministic as the process of niche differentiation is very predictable 

whereas if the community is disturbance driven a stochastic, ie randomly organised community results, intermediate levels of river bed disturbance supports highest benthic diversity. Animals which are highly resistant or resilient tend to dominate in very high disturbance species, In communities with both disturbance and competition there are the most species with resistance and resilient colonizers and competitive species. Intermediate levels of river bed disturbance support highest benthic diversity (COPY IMAGE) Intermediate disturbance hypothesis. 

the relationship between disturbance and productivity can also be compared, (COPY IMAGE). When there is very little food available/ low productivity there will always be low diversity even with high disturbance, as productivity increases the effect of disturbance is far more pronounced with intermediary disturbance levels leading to high diversity.
if disturbance is low animals like snails which are protected and good at feeding dominate, at high disturbance snails are not very mobile so mobile generalist resilient species tend to dominate, both will co-occur at intermediary levels. 

### Predation as distrubance.
Blugill sunfish in American streams. rapid spawning allows rapid expansion of blue gill populations the intensity of the blue gill as a mortality source to its prey leads to variation in their impact, (on macroinvertibrates). By feeding on abundant prey such species act to mediate diversity by controlling competitively dominant species. disturbance can have a knock on effect on predators and their ability to mediate prey. for example trout are very efficient predators, so will wipe out local fish (galaxiids) if they reach a certain minimum population size, however trout are far less resilient to flooding, . the bed stability can be used as a indication of which species will be present in very stable beds, (low flood disturbance, ) trout only, conversely in low bed stability, high flooding only galzxiids, and in intermediary levels there is co-oncurrence. In general co-co-occurrence is more frequent in disturbed streams. 

predatory exclusion limited to stable streams.
