# Light
If the net shortwave (solar) radiation incident on the ocean surface exceeds the net long wave radiation emitted as heat, then the is a surplus of radiation which manifests in the form of heat or light within the oceans themselves. 


## Depth Profile
Near the surface light is absorbed by photosynthetic organisms, and dissolved solids leading to a rapid decreases in light intensity with depth. Further down, there is a more gradual decrease in light intensity due almost exclusively to the absorption by water. 

### Wavelength dependence
Some wavelengths filter out faster than others, red light for example is absorbed in the top five meters. Frequencies of light associated with the absorbance spectrum of water, and absorbance by secondary photosynthetic pigments decrease particularly fast.

## Measurement

### Secchi disk 
Secchi disks are used for measuring transparency/ water clarity/turbidity.

## Global distribution
Near the poles there is less solar energy reaching surface waters due to the angle of incident of solar radiation on the atmosphere.
