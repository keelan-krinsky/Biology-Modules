# Dissolved Oxygen
Oxygen is not particularly soluble in water with only about 0.1-0.6\% of global oxygen dissolved in the oceans at any given time. In the tropics in particular oxygen concentration can be quite low due to the temperature of the water, so oxygen often acts as a limiting factor for aquatic life in such areas. 


## Depth Profile
Oxygen Concentration is high in surface waters as oxygen is introduced into surface waters from the mixing of water by wind, and by the lysis of water in photosynthesis, carried out by phytoplankton. Oxygen concentration then drops dramatically in the decomposition zone, as decomposers use up most of the dissolved oxygen in their normal respiration. This biological oxygen demand in conjunction with the lack of water mixing resulting from the formation of a thermocline and associated Pycnocline lead to the formation of a oxygen minimum zone/ shadow zone lying somewhere between 200 and 1500 meters down, with extremely low oxygen concentration. Underneath the shadow zone, oxygen concentration increases with increased depth due to the decreased temperature of the water (Solubility of a gas in a liquid is inversely proportional to temperature). Furthermore as depth increases past this point there are less decomposers, and less life in general and so less biological oxygen demand.
