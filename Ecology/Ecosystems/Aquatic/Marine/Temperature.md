# Temperature
Ocean water freezes at about $-2^\circ C$ and temperature range in ocean is about from $-2^\circ C-30^\circ C$, which is much larger than the change in salinity. Hence temperature will drive density differentials more than salt concentration. 

## Depth Profile
Temperature maintained high at the surface as hot water is less dense and rises, past a certain area where good mixing occurs, below the thermocline, dense cold layer. 

>DEFINITION: A thermocline is an abrupt change in the temperature profile of the temperature.
