# Chlorophyll Concentration

## Depth Profile
Chlorophyll concentration initially decreases, before leveling out at an approximately concentration which holds until about 280m. This constant level is due to migration of phytoplankton, which move down to capture nutrients and then back up to capture sunlight continuously. Below the thermocline (about 280m below the surface) there is a huge drop in chlorophyll concentration,as phytoplankton can not easily migrate past this point due to the associated density gradient.

QUESTION: why cant animals move past the thermocline, because they physically cant move into higher pressure zones, or because they cannot survive in higher pressure zones.
