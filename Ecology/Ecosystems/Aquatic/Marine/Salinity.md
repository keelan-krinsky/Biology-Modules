# Salinity

## Salt content 
Although the concentration of salt in sea water may change, the ratio of ions tends to remain very similar, ( an example of the rule of constant proportions established in Redfield ratios
The top 6 ions make up approximately 99\% of all dissolved ions in sea water.

### Origin 
Most ions in sea water are produced by chemical weathering of rocks on land (mostly cations $Na^+, K^+,Mg^{2+}$), or are released from the earths interior through hydrothermal vents (hot smokers), and volcanoes, (mostly anions such as $HS^-, Cl^-$).


 
## Depth Profile

>DEFINITION: A halocline is an abrupt change in the vertical profile of the temperature. 

### Surface salinity
On average ocean surface salinity 35 ranges $33-37PSU$. In the red sea surface salinity is about 40PSU. 



### Global distribution 
Surface salinity is generally higher around the equator and lower closer to the poles. This is because higher evaporation in the moving towards the equator, and high precipitation rates at the poles. 

### Effects of ice formation
Salt is forced out of water as it freezes, leading to the generation of high density high salt concentration, cold water at the poles around the polar icecaps which moves downward en mass, driving global circulation patterns.
