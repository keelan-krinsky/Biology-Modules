# Currents

## Causative factors

### Winds 
Prevailing winds can lead to the formation of currents due to the frictional force between air and water. 

## Gyres
Gyres are large circular ocean currents. 

### Causative factors
Gyres result from friction between winds and surface water layers. Northern hemisphere gyre circle to the right, southern hemisphere Gyres circle to the left/anticlockwise, (due to Coriolis force)

Each gyre is formed by a strong fast, deep, narrow western current  working in conjunction with a weak, shallow and broad eastern current. By the poles very sharp turns in the gyres are seen, where as at the equator there is no significant Coriolis acting on the current and so continental blocking alone forces the water downwards and around the cycle.

## South Africa 
There are two main currents off the South African coast the  Agulhas, (weak and broad) and  Benguela (strong and deep) 

### Ecological effect
The different currents help to set up three different biogeographical regions.

#### Western coast. 
Subtropical, Cool temperate region. 

#### South coast
cape Agulhas to Capetown, Warm temperate region. 

#### East coast 
Subtropical region.
