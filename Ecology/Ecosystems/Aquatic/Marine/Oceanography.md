## Background

### History
5 years ago 95\% of water already allocated, currently close to 100\%.

### 1998 National water act (36 of 1998) 
Four principles. All water captured forms the reserve, normally studied at quaternary catchments.
Government infrastructure is an important source of information.


### Water reserve
reserve contains requirements not only for quantity but also for quality and patterns of flow. Natural patterns are important to mimic because they act as quotes for fresh water organisms.

#### Ecological reserve

#### Basic human needs reserve 

#### International agreements 
quite a small component

> NOTE: reserve as in how much water must be retained by local government in dams on the catchment.
