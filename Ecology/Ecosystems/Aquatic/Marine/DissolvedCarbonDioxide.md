# Dissolved Carbon Dioxide

>NOTE: Concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide and partial pressure of carbon dioxide for all intents and purposes are the same thing. 

## Background

### __Solubility: Solubility: Gas in Liquid__

## Reactivity 
Carbon dioxide once dissolved can react further to form carbonates and bicarbonates. These reactions pull the dissolution equilibrium to the right leading to a high overall solubility of $CO_2$ in water. In fact about 80\% of all dissolved gas in the oceans is $CO_2$ and the oceans contain about 50 times more $CO_2$ in total than the atmosphere does. 

## Depth Profile 
The surface water has a relatively low concentration of carbon dioxide due to the relatively high temperature of the water. In total this regions contains about $1.020Gt$ of carbon. Moving down the from the surface areas there is an rapid increase in carbon dioxide levels due to decreased temperature and increased biological respiration. The surface areas are separated from deeper water by a pycnocline which prevents physical mixing, and below this pycnocline, in the cold deep water $CO_2$ is very high increasing slightly with depth.

## Temperature dependence
$CO_2$ concentration is closely dependant on water temperature, with lower temperatures promoting higher concentration.
