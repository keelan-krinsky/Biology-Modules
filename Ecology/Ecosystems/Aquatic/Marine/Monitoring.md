## Measuring Devices


### Sediment trap
Doppler radar is attached to the top of the device, which uses radar to infer the dominant currents, and changes is salinity at the water surface. The chain holding the sediment traps can be over 5km long, with sediment traps spread out across its length(/depth). Each trap contains 12 bottles which are rotated automatically on a monthly basis, (at any given time only one bottles is collecting sediment. ).The amount of carbon in each sample can be then be determined, and used to construct a depth profile.
