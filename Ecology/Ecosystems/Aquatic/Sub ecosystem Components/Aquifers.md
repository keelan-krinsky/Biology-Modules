# Aquifers 
Ground water flows in a number of different layers, known as aquifers. These aquifers consist of bands of rock with enough space/holes to allow water to percolate through it. Aquifers are normally confined, and separated from each other, by a bed of impermeable rock. 

## Flow Regime
Different aquifers will have different flow rates/regimes, varying from days to centuries, between infiltration and run out. The flow rate is generally related to the depth of the aquifer and in fact, there are certain very deep confined aquifers which take millennia to fill up, such as the table mountain aquifer.
