# Okavango Delta

The Okavango Delta is an endorheic pan (on a subcontinental level) which drains the Kalahari basin. Summer rainfall flows from the Angola highlands down into the Okavango Delta. After the summer rains the wetland/lake swells to about three times it's permanent size. Approximately sixty percent of the contained water is then evaporated off in the dry season, and the remain water is lost by infiltration.

## Lake Ngati
About 2% of the summer run off flows over into the adjacent Lake Ngati when the Okavango Delta overfills, however such overflows are only irregular and seasonal.In 
fact the area in which the Ngati lake formed was completely dry for nearly 20 years, but after a period of particularly heavy rainfall between 2010 and 2012 the Okavango Delta was filled to capacity and run off into the adjacent area formed Lake Ngati. This run off contained not only water but also nutrients, invertebrates and fish to colonise the new environment. Fishing communities soon migrated on mass to the new lake.

### Catastrophic Floods
In Very large floods, such as a one in fifty year flood, water will overflow into the adjacent basin, the Makgadikgadi salt pans.


>NOTE: The Okavango Delta contains many smaller scale exorheic wetlands within it, lying alongside the main channel.
