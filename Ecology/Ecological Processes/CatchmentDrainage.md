# Catchment Drainage 
All the water which falls within a given catchment will flow into the stream. Different drainage basins are dived by a watershed (the line connecting the highest points between the two basins. 

## Drainage density 
The drainage density is defined as the amount of stream channel required to drain one unit of catchment area. The same area drained by more tributaries has a higher drainage density. 

## Tributary arrangement. 
The tributary arrangement can vary, related to both topography, which can dictate direction of water flow, and geology, which leads to specific weathering patterns and channel formation. 

### Dendritic
In the dendritic arrangement many small tributaries drain into one main channel

> NOTE: Dendritic Meaning hand-like

### Radial
In the radial arrangement many tributaries run outwards from a central point in all directions 

### Centripetal
Multiple tributaries draining inwards towards a central point, a depression/pan of some form.

### Paralleled
In a parallel system tributaries run remarkably parallel to each other down the landscape. This phenomenon results where the drainage occurs over rock formations including very hard rock types which the water cannot easily penetrate. As a result water penetrates on either side of the bands of hard rock present in the formation, and so parallel channels on either side of each band result.
 
### Trellis 
In a trellis system within tributaries water flows with consecutive right angle changes in its direction. This pattern results when the rock formation which the water drains over contains blocks of very hard impermeable rocks in a perpendicular pattern, with softer rock in between. Channels form by erosion of the softer rock, changing direction to flow perpendicularly whenever a block of hard rock is encountered, in this way the water always flows parallel to the hard rock depositions. 

### Distributary
In a distributary system the river breaks up into distributary channels. This conformation occurs often, just before entering the sea for example.
