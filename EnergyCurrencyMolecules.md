# Energy Currency Molecules. 
High energy molecules (__HighEnergyMolecules__) react with water or oxygen in the environment to release energy, which can be used for biological energy transport. Because of their role in energy transport, these molecules referred to as the energy currency of the cell. 


>NOTE Energy currency molecules are used for energy transport only and not for long term energy storage. 

## Energy barrier.
In general the activation energy required for the oxidation, or hydrolysis of any given energy currency molecule is very large. As a result such molecules are not particularly unstable and will not rapidly react in a biological environment until they are combined with the appropriate enzyme to provide a lower activation energy reaction path. Because enzymes must be involved for the reaction to take place the energy which they release can be utilised in a controlled manner, often by coupling with other endergonic biological reactions.
