# Reaction Order
The reaction order with respect to a specific reactant is the power to which that component is raised in the rate equation for the reaction. The overall reaction order is the arithmetic sum of the reaction order's of all reactants. 

> NOTE: the reaction order is not expressed directly as an integer (such as 1 or 2) but rather as first, second...etc.
