# Evolutionary History
The earliest signs of life on earth (cells), in the form of microfossils of cells, that resemble bacteria, date back to 3.5 billion years ago. This implies that the development of the first cell must have started before that time, in 1b years between dating of fossil, and condensation of primitive earth. i.e between 3.5-4.5 billion years ago. 

>NOTE: As the definition of Life interlinked with the definition of cells, the evolutionary history of the cell, is the same history as the origin of life on earth.

>NOTE: Time operating on this scale is sometimes hard to comprehend. 

Currently The origin of life is preposed to have come from chemical reactions on early earth, life originated as a product of chemical reactions on early earth, These gave rise to the early building blocks of life. Nucleic acid, protein, carbohydrates and lipids. 

#### Earth Formation
Earth originally formed from condensing interstellar gas, after the big band. As this gas cloud condensed various chemical reactions were triggered, creating what is colloquially referred to as the primordial/ primeval soup. For life to arise in this primordial soup, requires the generation of the molecule which can replicate. (A molecule able to make new generations of molecules like itself.). The only biological molecule capable of this replication, which scientists are currently aware of, are the nucleic acids. Presently there are two types known of RNA and DNA. The basis to present day genetic information. It is therefore, assumed that the first living molecules on earth were nucleic acids. 

The only plausible alternative theory proposes that certain minerals were the first replicators, in particular clay. (There are many types of clays on earth). However even if it was, for argument sake clays, eventually there would have had to have been a transfer from minerals to nucleic acid, as the replicating molecule. Life today depends crucially on proteins, For two central reasons, Firstly proteins are required to replicate the nucleic acids, and secondly proteins are required for energy metabolism. The proteins themselves are encoded in the nucleic acid, leading to circularity. The formation of this circular dependency between proteins are nucleic acids lies in. There is evidence that the earth during its formative years was characterised by volcanic type eruptions, lightning, some form of rain, in a cloud of hydrogen, methane and ammonia. These conditions were able to give rise to simple organic molecules, (that is molecules containing carbon). UV radiation could also have contributed as an energy source. 

Evidence in the Miller experiment, if Hydrogen, methane and ammonia and water vapour are mixed in a heated environment, and then energized either with an electrical discharge or UV radiation, the gasses reacts to form small organic molecules.

Two small organic molecules in particular are of importance, firstly $HCN$ and formaldehyde $HCHO$. These two molecules readily undergo further reactions in an aqueous environment. Therefore the earths first atmosphere was likely to be hydrogen filled, making it a reducing atmosphere. This hydrogen filled reducing atmosphere is referred to as the primary atmosphere $1^\circ$

Overtime the primary atmosphere was replaced by the secondary atmosphere, which was also reducing as it was predominately $HCN$, Life therefore evolved under reducing conditions, which implies that it was initially anaerobic. 

### More Complex molecules 
Firstly: $CO+NH_3\rightarrow HCN+H_2O$
and $2CH_4+N_2\rightarrow +3H_2$

Purines are derived from $HCN via the cyanamides.and dicyandiimide. Via the nitriles amino acids are formed and via cyanoacetlyene pyrimidines are formed. 
Amino acids added to a crusible and heated strongly ($>200^\circ C$ for 3 hours leads), will form protein 
Polymers can form either spontaneously (some amino acid mixtures will do this), Or through dry heat activation.


The first carbohydrate was likely to be a sugar and was likely to be ribose. The most likely source of pre biotic material was the sugar ribose, but not deoxyribose. Because ribose can relatively easily be synthesised from formaldehyde. In present day organisms all deoxyribonucleotides nucleotides are synthesised from RNA precursors. 

By ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase. Therefore the pathway for RNA synthesis formed before that for DNA. At this point the early earth is referred to as the RNA world. Once a polymer of nucleic acid is formed, it can influence the formation of other polymers. A sequence of nucleic acid can specify the sequence of a new polymer by acting as a template. In addition, A sequence of one type of nucleotide, for example, a polymer of uradilic acid, (the nucleotide which forms part of uracil), determining a polymer of a different nucleotide, (such as a adenine polymer), through complimentary base pairing. There are two major features of these early polymers, that are of importance, firstly they have templating properties, which is critical for replication, and secondly the potential to fold up thus forming complex surfaces, that catalyse a variety of other reactions. 

As RNA is a single strand so the two most difficult aspects of working with it are, one that it folds up on itself, naturally, and two it is unstable, so is very readily eaten by RNases. The folding is due to intramolecular complimentary base pairing. Templating mechanisms today require catalysts which promote them. There protein catalysts would not have been present in the prebiotic soup.

On primordial earth these catalytic activities could have been performed by metal ions, or minerals such as clays. 

Variation is required for life. This variation was introduced through many reactions occurring over millions of years, leading to the formation of stable replicating polymers through trial and error. Mutations/errors in replication allowed for primitive evolution with retained mutations adding to variation. In the case of RNA, the molecules with mutations would have different functional properties, as they would fold differently leading to a different shape, with different exposed groups. The final conformation of the molecule would therefore determine its behaviour. In particular the 3D conformation of a polynucleotides affects three things critical to the system. One its stability, two its ability to replicate, and three, its action on other molecules. (as surface determines activity). RNAs had therefore had two important characteristics, firstly they carried information (in the sequence of nucleotides), and secondly they were functional. These two characteristics, information and functionality, are the two critical properties for evolution. Ribosomes, are mostly nucleic acids, and have catalytic activity, ribosomes are able to, cleave other nucleic acid, and to ligate/ join two sequences of nucleic acid, further ribozymes can engage in self splicing. In particular there are self splicing introns which are ribozymes. Ribozymes known to exist are evidence for the targeted generation of variation, cutting at a particular sequences and joining at a particular sequence.
