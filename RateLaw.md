# Rate Law
A rate law relates the concentration of reactants to the overall rate of the reaction. Rate laws are expressed in the form.

$v=\text{k}[X_1]^x_1[X_2]^x_2...$

where k is the rate constant/constant of proportionality.\newline
$X_1, X_2...$ are the reactant involved in the reaction\newline
$x_1,x_2...$ are the respective orders of each reactant. 

## Order 
The order with respect to a given reactant expresses the relationship between the change in the concentration of the reactant and the resulting change in reaction rate. By equation: \newline
$(\frac{C_1}{C_2})^x=\frac{v_1}{v_2}$

where $C_1,C_2$ are two different concentrations. \newline
$v_1,v_2$ are the reaction rates at each concentration.\newline
x is the order with respect to the given reactant.\newline
