# Microorganisms
Microorganism is a general term used to describe all organisms too small to be seen with the naked eye. There are six main types of microorganisms namely: fungi, bacteria, viruses, protozoa, archaea and algae.

## __Viruses: Viruses__

## __Fungi: Fungi__

## __Protozoa: Protozoa__

## __Bacteria: Bacteria__

## __Algae: Algae__

## __Archaea: Archaea__

## Background

### Nomenclature.
The Linnaeus system of classification is used. Any given organism is described by its genus, in combination with a specific epithet, i.e. it's species name. For example *Staphylocuccus Aureus*

## Ecological Niche
Microorganisms can be producers or decomposers. 


## Human impact.

### Food Spoilage
Microorganisms can lead to food spoilage. When humans eat food contaminated with microorganisms they are t risk of severe sickness of even death, either because the microorganism themselves are toxic or because some product of their metabolism, eg a waste product is. Closely related is the risk of infection from ingesting a pathogenic micro-organism.

### Direct uses  

#### __MOIA: Microorganisms Industrial Applications__

## Laboratory Work


### __LabSafety: Lab Safety__

#### Aseptic techniques.
Aseptic technique are used to avoid contamination of microorganism samples under study in the laboritory. One major source of contamination is the air itself. Millions of bacteria fall on each $m^2$ of the earths surface per day.

##### Agar plates
An agar plate consists of the agar medium, a gelly like substance extracted from seaweed which is used to form a regular support matrix to which food sources, such as sugars and proteins are added.

## Nomenclature.

The linnaeus system of classification is used. Any given organism is described by its genus, in combination with a specific epithet, i.e. it's species name, For example *Staphylocuccus Aureus*

NOTE: Genus and species names should always be italisized, (or underlined when hand written). Furthermore the first time a microorgansim is reffered to in a text its full name should be given, after which the genus name can be abbreviated to an initial.

## Bacteria

### Cellular consituents.
Bacteria are prokaryotes, so lack a nucleus and associated nuclear membrane.

#### Cell wall  
All bacteria have a cell wall, and these cell walls contain peptidoglycans.

### Replication
Bacteria replicate most commonly by binary fission.

#### Binary fission
Binary fission results in two approximately equally sized daughter cells, which are genetically identical. This form of reproduction is assexual.

### Energy Source.
Bacteria can oxidise organic or inorganic chemicals, to produce energy. Some are also capable of photosynthesis.

NOTE: The ability to produce energy by oxidation of inorganic chemicals is relatilvely unique to bacteria.

## Archaea
NOTE: Archae are often covered in less detail not because they are far less widespread or numberous than other microorganisms but becuase they are relatively unstudied. The lack of study is explained by their extreme habitats making them harder to sample/collect and grow in labs, and the related fact that they seldom interact with humans and do not act as human pathogens.

### Cellular Components.
Archaea are prokaryotes.

### Cell walls
Not all archae possess cell walls and those that do, do not contain peptidoglycans.

### Habitat
Archaea live in a diversity of 'extreme' envirments.

#### Methalogens
Methalogens live in environments which contain lots of methane producing bacteria (methane is a waste product of their metabolism).

#### (Extreme) Halophiles
Live in very high salt concentrations.

#### (Extreme) Thermophiles.
Live in very high temperature environments. ($>115^\circ C$  easily)

NOTE: The combined biomass of all bacteria under the surface of the earth is greater than the combined biomass of all plants and animals on the earth.

## Fungi

### Cellular consituents.
Fungi are eukaryotic.

#### Cell wall
All Fungi posses cell walls made of chitin.

#### Energy source.
Fungi metabolised organic molecules for an enery source.

### Higher organisation
Fungi can be unicellular in the case of yeasts, or multicellular in the case of molds and mushrooms. Multicelluar fungi consist of a mass of filamentous hyphae which together form a tangled mess known as the mycelium.  

### Reproduction
Fungi can reporduce both sexually and assexually.

### Life cycle
Fungi can be parasitic or free living.


## Protozoa
Absorb/ ingest organic materila.

### Motility
May be motile, due to the presence of flagella.


### Reproduction
Protozoa can reproduce both sexually and assexually.

### Life cycle
Protozoa can be parasitic or free living.

## Algae

### Cellular components.
Algae are eukaryotes,

#### Cell wall
Algae posses a cellulose cell wall.

### Energy Source
Photosynthesis is used to produce (more more accurately store energy) in the form of carbon sugars.

NOTE: photosyntheisis is not necessarily oxygenic, i.e. it does not necessarily involve the formation of oxygen.

### Reproduction
Algae reproduce sexually and assexually

### Energy source.
Algae can use the oxygen they generate in photosynthesis for their respiration, and in general to produce oxygenic compounds.

### Morphology
Strikingly algae can become unusually large for single cellular organisms, eg giant kelp.

## Viruses.
Viruses are acelluar.

### Genetic material
Viruses can contain either DNA or RNA as their genetic material.

NOTE: All other microorgansims rely predominately on DNA but also contain an RNA component (eg rRNA) so extracting pure DNA or pure RNA is difficult. In the case of viruses however either exclusively DNA or exclusively RNA will be present.

### Numerosity and distribution
Viruses may in fact be the most numerous microorganisms. The evidence for this claim lies in the fact that for all studied bacteria at least one bacteriophage specific to that bacterial species has been discovered, and in fact it is currently thought that there are at least two bacteriophages per bacterial species one with a lytic and one with a lysogenic life cycle. Furthermore for each infected bacteria there will be on the order of $10^8$ phage, hence as bacteria were suspected to be the most numerous, viruses (in terms of the phage component alone) can be considered to be the most numerous.

##  Multicelluar animal parasites.
These species are considered to be microorganims in the sense that they have a stage fo their life cycle which is microscopic, this is far from the general classification system however.


### Cell constituents.
Multicellular animal parasites are exclusively eukaryotic.

### Higher organisation
they are by definintion multicellular.

### Jeans example. 
Theoretically an entire pair of jeans could be made from microorganism derrived products. The indigo dye used is derrived for *E. coli*. The bleach used is derrived from peroxidase in mushrooms, even the buttons could be made from plastics which bacteria can be manipulated to produce. 


NOTE: Genus and species names should always be italicized, (or underlined when hand written). Furthermore the first time a microorganism is referred to in a text its full name should be given, after which the genus name can be abbreviated to an initial.

### Lab safety
If agar plates are cultivated with successive imprints of a persons fingers, normally by the sixth plate there are still enough microorganism transferred that significant growth is observed.

### Lab techniques

#### Aseptic techniques.
Aseptic technique are used to avoid contamination of microorganism samples under study in the laboratory. One major source of contamination is the air itself. Millions of bacteria fall on each $m^2$ of the earths surface per day.

## Bacterial structure and function

#### Agar plates
An agar plate consists of the agar medium, a jelly like substance extracted from seaweed which is used to form a regular support matrix to which food sources, such as sugars and proteins are added.

### Electron micrograph 
An electronmicrograph is prepared the following process: 

 #. bacteria are spun into a liquid gel medium. 
 #. the cell is solidified and dehydrated with ethanol, and then placed in a block of (liquid?) resin, which is relatively hard but soft enough to be cut by the diamond (or occasionally) glass blade cutter.
 #. nm thick sections are sliced off the block and float off onto water from which they are retrieved with the use of a special grid, and fixed onto a slide. 


 
 NOTE: literally hundereds of slides would be required to build up a 3D image, which even then would be distorted by the process of dehydration. 

## Ecological niche
Microorganism are both producers and decomposers, (they produce organic sugars both by photosynthesis and by chemolithotrophic. 
Microorganisms can be mutualists, some are pathogens. The are also vital in maintaining the geochemistry planet cycle.

## Anthropic Appilications. 
The two major applications of microorganisms are in production of fermented foods and beverages (for example beer/ethanol in any alcohol and yogurt) and industrial chemicals for example insulin. 

### Jeans example. 
Theoretically an entire pair of jeans could be made from microorganism derived products. The indigo dye used is derived for *E. coli*. The bleach used is derived from peroxidase in mushrooms, even the buttons could be made from plastics which bacteria can be manipulated to produce. 

NOTE: The production of plastics is related to the natural pathway for the production of bicarbonates (?). 

### Anthropic impact. 
Microorganisms can lead to food spoilage. When humans eat food contaminated with microorganisms they are at risk of severe sickness of even death, either because the microorganism themselves are toxic or because some product of their metabolism, eg a waste product is. Closely related is the risk of infection from ingesting a pathogenic micro-organism.

## Bacterial structure and function

### Learning Outcomes.

 #. What are bacteria
 #. What is the structure of a bacterium
 #. What are the sizes and morphologies of bacteria.

### Cell constituets.
Bacteria are prokaryotes so the have no true membrane enclosed nucleus (TMEN) ie no nucleus or nuclear membrane.

#### Genetic material
The genetic material of bacteria in compacted and contained within a region of the cytoplasm known as the nuceloid, however this region is not set or enclosed, it is merely the region in which the genetic material is found.

#### Mitochondria
bacteria do not contain mitochondria because they are essentially mitochondria (or more accurately they have a common ancestor with the mitochondria of eukarytic cells and can perform a similar respiratory process with their own cell membrane as mitochondria perform with their outer membrane. )

NOTE: generally speaking prokaryotes are less complex than eukaryotes. 

### Morphology 
The most common bacterial shapes are spherical/coccus and rod shaped/bacillus, however these are far from the only possible shapes. 

NOTE: Most bacteria are monomorphic, i.e. only take on one shape so shape is a good identifying characteristic. 

#### Colonial association 
Individual bacteria can associate in a number of different ways, but a given species will (generally) only have one form of colonial association. 
Common forms include, Paired (Diploid), Clustered and chained. 

#### Diploid
A single division would lead to a paired conformation, provided the bacteria do not separate

#### Strepto
Repeated binary fission in the same axis would lead to the formation of a chain. 

#### Tetra
Binary fission first along one axis and then along a perpendicular axis would lead to the formation of a square

#### Sarcinae
Binary fission along three perpedicular axies. would lead to a structure consisting of eight bacteria.

#### Staph
multiple divisions along multiple axes lead to a disorganized mass of bacteria 

NOTE: there is not clear advantage to these association. They are most probably caused by the presence of sticky (stuff?) on the outside of the bacteria's surface. 

#### Multinucleiod
some bacteria can take on a miltinucleoid filamentous structure.

#### Angular 
some bacteria snap back into a specific angle relative to each other after binary fission, probably due to incomplete separation of the cell walls of daughter cells.

#### Pallisade
Bacteria snap back to lie directly adjacent to each other.

#### Coccibacillus
Very short rods and can be very hard to distinguish from true cocci bacteria. 

#### Bifurication 
Bifurcation can occur to give Y shaped bacteria

#### Vibrion
bacteria have a distinct curved rod morphology. 

#### Spriillion 

bacteria take on a corkscrew shape \newline 

#### Spirochete
bacteria take on a corkscrew shape ( more flexible than Spirillion)

#### Walt's square bacterium
dimensions of about $2\mu m \,\text{x}\,2-4\mu m \,\text{x}\, 0.2 \mu m$ taking on the shape of a square or a rectangle. 

NOTE: some bacteria are  polymorphic changing their shape continuously. 

#### Endospores 
There are often endospores within bacteria which can cause swelling changing shape. 

### Plasiticty 
bacteria have the facility to adapt their environment by changing their gene expression patterns.  

### Size. 
The average is about $0.2-1.0\mu \text{x} 2-8\mu m$
For example E. coli $1.1-1.5\mu \text{x} 2-6\mu m$

#### Smallest. 
$100-300nm$ range, and ultramicrobacteria which are about $50nm$ in size. Very nutrient poor so do not maintain large cytoplasm.

#### Largest. 
Bacteria Epulopiscium fishelsoni

$80\mu m-600\mu m$ (visible with the naked eye), about $10^6$ times larger in volume than most bacteria

##### reproduction 
produces daughter cells inside the mother, which then pop out through a slit. 

##### Addaptions 
The key limitation to size is SA:V, as movement of nutrients and gasses are by diffusion. This problem is overcome in part by massive invaginations of the surface membrane. (Additional problem of transporting proteins to membrane as membrane already covered in proteins.). 

It was thought that a particular bacterium would have one copy of a bacterium, however in Epulopiscium fishelsoni chromosome number increases with size, also as transcription and translation are linked, if the gene is everywhere in the cell, then a protein can be produced anywhere in the cell and the need for sophisticated transport systems in removed. The number of copies of important genes can be in the hundred thousands, for example ribosomal RNA genes. 

##### Thiomargarita namibiensis 
very large volume. 

###### Addaptations 
cytoplasm is filled with vacuoles so minimal depth of cytoplasm from any point. Epulopiscium fishelsoni requires nutrient dense environment so lives in fish and floats around to find nutrient dense areas. 

The other advantage of size is that it hep avoid (protozoan) predation. 

## Structure and function  

NOTE: Not all structures are found in all bacteria. Some structures are specific to specific bacteria some are specific to the bacterium's environment, ie parasitic only produce a capsule when they encounter a host immune response. 

(Copy image of bacteria)

NOTE: cytoplasm is actually packed/ very full of constituents. 

### Plasma membrane. 
they are the main contact point between the cell and its surroundings. functions splits internal and external environment in its capacity as a boundary layer, and allows the exchange of matter and information between the internal and external environment. 

NOTE: bacteria are very plastic in their response to the environment improving energy efficiency 

#### Fliud mozaic model 
Phospholipids+ integral and poriferal proteins

#### Membrane associated lipids
Amphiphatic, (hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups associated with them), most of these lipids are phospholipids, they spontaneously arrange with phosphate head by water to form low energy micelles or bilayers. 

Phospholipids are diverse and complex groups. Phosphatidylethanolamine (75\%)
phosphatidylglycerol (20\%)
cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol, 1-5\%)

Important as they confer strength, and spread out overall negative charge of the plasma membrane and cardiolin can play a role are a chaperon, helps lactase permease fold correctly in the membrane.

For a particular species of phospholipid the fluidity is adjusted by saturation/desaturation of tails, to fit the requirements of the external environment. 

Lipids can also flip between leaflets of the membrane, there are proteins flipases (out to in), flopases (in to out) require ATP, and scamblases (exchange) do not require ATP. Related to adaptions to environmental changes such as  temperature (with season). 

NOTE:membrane is packed with proteins, especially in bacteria which require membrane proteins for energy production, this applies especially of bacteria with less efficient respiration processes. 

#### Glycolipids 
heterogeneous

##### Functions
 
 #. Help to stabilize the plasma membrane (protective function)
 #. Important in cell-cell interactions 
    #. Adhesion. (contact inhibition, muscles, desosomes etc)
    #. identification (the flip side is that is can be recognized by the host immune system). 
    #. assist in signal transduction. 
    
#### Transport systems 
A transport system is required to move across the plasma membrane, could be for toxins such as bacteriosin which attach other bacteria in the environment, They can also trap food outside the PM to prevent its loss. Furthermore important metabolic functions such as photosynthesis and respiration involve the plasma membrane. Motility is also associated with plasma membrane associated structures, and the synthesis of many important chemicals. 

NOTE: bacteria can distinguish which host they are infecting and can adapt accordingly. 

#### Integral membran proteins. 
make up about 60-70\% of membrane proteins. These proteins can move around the membrane freely by diffusion.  

###### Ease of removal. 

tend to be relatively difficult to remove in aqueous environments (as low solubility). 
Such proteins are usually embedded deeply, some may span the entire membrane. To span the membrane they must be amphiphathic (otherwise would flip into the membrane). 


##### Periferal proteins. 
20-30\% 

###### Ease of removal 
relatively easier to remove, as they are on the outside, and more soluble in aqueous environments. 

(Copy image of the plasma membrane. )






NOTE: there is no reason for the tails to align between layers. 

##### S layer 
additional very strong outer layer formed on membrane

### Cell wall 
The majority of bacteria posses a cell wall. 


### Nucleiod 

### Gas Vacoules. 

### Inclusion bodies 

### Robosomes. 

### Cell enveope. 
contains the outer membrane(where present) the cell wall and the cell membrane
 
### External  Structures

#### Capsule 
A capsule is very similar to a slime layer but consists primarily of proteins and exhibits increased organisation and structural integrity. Capsules are also more firmly attached to the bacterium cell wall. A capsule implies a cost as many valuable food substances must be placed outside the cell to constitute it however it also confers several important benefits. A capsule makes the bacterium, more resistant to dessication and phagocytosis, (especially in mammalian hosts), it also  facilitates substrate adherence to substrate, increases antibiotic and bacteriophage resistance and acts as a readily accessible store of carbohydrates. Finally it even relieves osmotic pressure acting of the cell. 

NOTE: The capsule is very thick compared to the bacterium. 

NOTE: Capsules do not take up stain, so they are visualised by using a (positive) primary stain for the bacterium and a (negative) secondary stain for a background. The unstained region remain is then the capsule. Colorless shiny bacterium are likely to be pathogenic. 

#### Slime layer 
A slime layer is a layer of material outside of the cell wall, consisting of extracellular, polymeric substances. (EPS)
A slime payer consists primarily of polysaccharides , but may also contain proteins. It is not very tightly attached to the bacterium

#### S layer. 
The S layer is always constituted of proteins or glycoproteins, which are set into a regular array. This layer is very hard to pull apart and behaves as a protective layer similar to chainmail. Individual links will compress into each other but only to a point, past this point further compression require very large forces. This protective layer helps to protect against bacterium such as _Del Virbio_ which crash into other bacteria at high speeds and then 'drill' into them to live inside them as paracites.  
### Internal membrane system. 
 
## Gram staining. 
The gram cell is able to differentiate between two major structure types based on their ability to maintain the primary stain in the presence of the de-coloriser. 
 Gram staining is bar far the most important staining in bacteriology. staining is also related to differences in the lipids. 


### Process
  #. Crystal violet.  
 # . Grams iodine. (Helps crystal violet to stick to the cell wall. ) 
 #. alcohol (decolorize), gram negative cells are decolorised, gram positive cells are not. 
 #. Safranin (red due 
 )
 
 Gram positive have red on purple so remain purple, gram negative have red on colorless so become red/pink.

 NOTE: If decolored too intensely any cell will lose its color. 
 
 NOTE: Acetone in involved in eyes dissolving.
 
### Posive 

Copy from slides. 

#### Cell wall 
Thick homogeneous cell wall containing 50\% peptidoglycan by dry weight. The peptidoglycan is about $20-80nm$ thick.

##### Periplasmic space 
A area in between the cell wall and cell membrane it is distinct (although so thin that it can often be hard to make out.). 

NOTE: The cell wall is the combination of the PG layer and the periplasmic space. 

NOTE: Try to draw structures with some sense of relative scale, ie the cell wall must be larger. 

\textbf{Copy image of cell wall from slides.}

##### Function 
Maintains the cell integrity against osmotic pressure and maintains the cell shape. cytoskeletal elements are a large part of it, but the peptidoglycan is also significant, and if it is removed the bacteria will usually become spherical

##### Techoic acids. 
(referred to as ? techoic acids), 
Techoic acids make up a significant proportion of the cell wall. They are covalently attached to the peptidoglycan, which has a mesh-like structure. Techoic acids fill (almost all) of the void spaces in this mesh extending all the way to the outside of the layer. 

Lipotechoic acids are embedded in the membrane at one end and the peptidogycan layer at the other. forming a stabilizing link. 

###### Functions 
help to maintain the structure of the cell wall. And confer an overall negative charge (to gram positive bacteria). 

The acids are also antigenic, (which benefits the host not the bacterium)

### Gram negative. 

#### Cell membrane 
5-7nm

#### Peptidoglycan layer
Much thinner $5-10\%$  of dry weight of cell negative bacteria. only about 1nm

#### Periplasmic space  
between cell and other membrane, much wider than in gram positive bacteria, can be go up to $70nm$, constituting a significant component of the cell. The Periplasmic space contains lots of proteins and enzymes, in particular those associated with nutrient acquisition such as binding proteins which move out of the cell and bind to nutrients making them easier for the cell to recognise. The Periplasmic space also plays an important role in  electron transport and energy production, and contains receptors important in chemotaxis. 

#### Outer membrane. 
5-7nm

phospholipid layer (not bilayer) which consists of an single layer of lipopolusaccharides, within which lipoproteins and proteins are found. More permeable/less selective than the cell membrane (?) The outside of gram negative is very wavy as more fluid than a PG layer. The outer membrane functions to prevent the loss of cellular constituents. 

NOTE: the outer membrane can be isolated as an intact spherical structure

##### Lipopolysaccharide '
Lipopolysaccharide is a virulence (disease causing) factor, which consists of three distinct segments, an outer chain a core polysaccharide, and lipid (embedded within the membrane). Lipopolysaccharide is particularly effective in minimizinf the effectiveness of an immune response in a mammalian host. 

###### Outer (O) chain 
In _E Coli_ alone there are at least 160 different versions of the O chain. The length of the chain often influences the roughness of a colony. Full length outer chains lead to a smoother more hydrophilic surface. Short outer chains lead to a rough more hydrophobic surface. The O side chain is antigenic, often recognised by the host in a immune response. Some bacteria can mutate their O chain by antigen shift to avoid an effective immune response.

###### Core polysaccharide. 
The core poly saccharide is short normally only 8 polysaccharides long. It shows far less variation than the Outer chain, but forms an important link between the outer chain and the membrane embedded A lipid. There is an accumulation of negative charge by the joint between the Core polysaccharide and lipid A which facilitates the intercalation of magnesium ions which help to stabilize the outer membrane, slotting in between the lipids of lipid A. The role of the $Mg^{2+}$ ions is so important that if a strong chelating agent is used to pull these ions out of the membrane that it looses its integrity and starts to break apart. This core component may contain amino acids. The hydrophobicity of the core polysaccharide prevents certain harmful substances from entering the cell. 

###### Lipid A
Lipid A consists of Phosphorylated N-acetylglucosamine and  6-7 fatty acids which are typically saturated, and does not extend past the membrane. It is almost invariably hydrophobic. Lipid A is a major component of the outer membrane and helps to stabilizes and protect cells, forming a permeability barrier which is very efficient at stopping lysozyme and bleaches, and bio-salts from entering and damaging the cell.

### Endotoxins. 
Endotoxins are bacterial components which are not produced and excreted by bacteria for the express purpose of toxicity but rather substances which play some chemical or structural role in the bacterium, which happen to be toxic to host cells. Endotoxins can nevertheless be extremely toxic, one example is the Botulin toxin (Botox) used in skin treatments. Lipopolysaccharides are also endotoxins which interact with plattlets in the blood decreasing their number to the point where internal bleeding may occur. 

##### Porins
make pores through the outer membrane, consist of three separate units. Porins are transmembrane proteins, which form channels for entrance and exit of certain substances, (they are essentially water filled channels) 

NOTE: The presence of Porins indicates the extent of the protective function of the outer layer, in that they show how selective it is in what substance may permeate through it. 

##### Brauns lipoprotein 
extends from the GP layer to the outer membrane. 

###### Function 
Helps to prevent membrane damage by giving it some form of rigidity, and preventing an indeterminate gap between the outer membrane and the rest of the bacteria, pulling the membrane into the same shape as the bacteria.  

##### Lipopolysachharides. (LPS)
Consist of lipids and carbohydrates. The outer leaflet of the membrane is almost entirely lipopolysacharide, and in genre it is an integral membrane component. 

$Salmonella typhimurium$ in Salmoella can be related to disease.

### Defining characteristics.

### Cell constituets.
Bacteria are prokaryotes so the have no tru membrane enclosed nucleus (TMEN) ie no nucleus or nuclear membrane.

#### Genetic material

## Major nutritional metabolic types. 

Autotrophes get there carbon from $CO_2$ in the environment. whereas heterotrophes get their carbon from organic compounds. some organisms especially bacteria can switch between different nutritional sources/mechanisms. 

NOTE: litho imples the electrons from an inorganic compounds. (electrons or energy)
NOTE: autotrophes require electrons for carbon dioxide reduction. 

### Photolithotrophic autotrophy 
energy comes from light, carbon comes from $CO_2$ in atmosphere, electrons are gained from inorganic substances water in the case of plants. 
cyanobacteria are an example

### Photoorganotrophiic heterotrophy 
Photosynthesis is used for energy but electrons and carbon are gained from an organic source, this is a very unusual way to grow and mainly bacteria, very few other organisms. purple (other pigments) and green (chlorophyll) non sulfur bacteria.

### Chemolithotrophc autotrophy 
grow without light and organic carbon electron sources, as well as organic carbon carbon sources, so grow in deep mines etc. 

### Chemoorganotrophic heterotrophy. 
energy from chemical respiration, i.e oxidation of organic compounds, electrons from organic compounds, and carbon from organic compounds. 

## Classification of microorganisms. 

### Old model (Universal tree of life)
From monera to protists to plants animals and fungi, and most diversity was thought to reside in the plant, animal and fungi kingdoms. 

### Three domains Woese
three and a half billion years was the first common ancestor. 

### Bacteria 
Only bacteria for about 2 billion years. 

NOTE: the diversity between cyanobacteria and protobacteria (or indeed any other bacterial clade) is greater than that between plants and animals. 

### Bdellovibrion
Prey on other bacteria, drills through other bacteria, preditor. 

### _Pelagibacter ubique_
Dominates in many environments, only discovered by FISH techniques, as could not culture it. Can make up about 20% of all prokaryotes in the oceas, and about 0.5% of all prokaryotes on the planet, and in hot ocean environments can be up to 50\% , even though theses environments can be quit harsh, about $2\cdot 10^{28}$. 
 very small so good SA:V, and so small its not predated on well, $0.4-0.9 \mu m$ by $0.1-0.2\mu m$. very simple, smallest genome known. complexity does not imply more evolutionary success. 

### Helicobacter. 
examples. 

### Archaea 

### Eukarya. 


### Human microbiome. 

microbiota
all the microbes in a community or that reside in an environmetnal niche. 

microbiome: the collective genomes of the microbes in a community or that reside in an environmental niche. (this is useful as many studies do not use cultures but rather molecular techniques. 

NOTE: This implies that humans are in fact just a collection of species. furthermore there are no homosapiens with no bacteria, and infact their cells are outnumbered by bacterial cells 10 to 1. so how does one distinguish between them. 

NOTE: there are several thousand bacteria species in most distinct areas of the human body, the large intestine in particular has over 30000 species. 

#### Natural childbirth. 
Should suzzarians be done, the microbial diversity on a newborn skin for natural vs Cesarean, they are very different. In the viginal tract there are large numbers of lactobacillales , so there are ar more lactobacilli on babies from natural birth. whereas from a Cesarean section is mostly those in the ovaries. The microbiome trains the immune system, if there are not there then diseases such as Exsema can result. 
moving down the digestional tract you end up with more bacteria. 

### Obesity
The relationship between obesity and the microbiome. Germ free mice. The germ free mice showed decreased propensity to obesity. in the gut there are firmicutes and Bacteriodetes, so if there are more Firmicutes there is more weight gain, as these bacteria are more effecient at giving them excess nutrient to the human body. Lean mice can be switched into obease and visa versa. 

Study in malawe, using twins, same food one mulnurished, diffs microbiome, can be changed back by ingestion of bacterial tables. 

### Anxiety and fear 
depend on the microbacteria. for example $Lactobacillus rhamnosus$ if fed to mice makes their anxiety go down, they start being less cautious of open spaces and water in particular. Autism and brain development. with high numbers of chlostridia, the brain produces phenols to kill bacteria , which damage the brain, so sulfur is added, but this may lead to a sulfur defficeincy which in turn may lead to brain damage later on. 


### Human health 
The microbiome cannot be cut out, should be thought of as a collective property of the human-associated microbiota. 

Open a window, an ecological perspective, restoration ecology, eat more plants, get your hands dirty, no antibiotics. 

#### AntiBiotics. 
switches from antibiotics are not always reversible, and highly unadvised. 

#### Major plays.


Virus identification, can use sequencing next gen/deep. 

### Life cycles of viruses. 
All occurs with a cell. when a virus enters a host. 

#### Stage one
 the virus must attach to the cell membrane receptors, combination of general and specific receptors, some viruses will onyl reproduce in specific tissues, some viruses can replicate only in one type of cell

 Penetreation by endocytosis or fusion (viruses which have an envelope, the two lipid membranes fuse together). endocytosis, means membrane invaginates around the virus leading to a double membrane around the viruses, 

 translocation, must get though the membrane, without bursting the membrane, which is added by the fluid nature of the membrane. 

 injection, in the case of bacteriopahges,

#### Uncoating
by viral or host enzymes (or both); pH, virus may contain its own enzymes to break down nucleic acids, in this case lipases specifically are used. 

#### Assembly and maturation 


#### 
biosyntheisi: Production of 


### Proteins within ther virion are bound to RNA to stabalise them, 

some viruses no uncoat completely, partly this is to prevent the cell and its degrading enzymes, especially dsRNA, becuase the celll degrades this in silencing. 

NOTE: Cell machinary refernce to enzymes and cofactors.

the virus fuses to the cell membrane leaving all of its envelope material on the outside. 

### Uncoating of viruses
Occurs via viral or host enzymes or both. 

capsid proteins bond together by electrostatic forces, 

the capsid protein is always encoded by the virus, only a few genes are for the strucure of the virus the rest are for proteins helping for virus take over of the cell.
