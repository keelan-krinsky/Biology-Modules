# Virion Constituents

## Matrix
The matrix is an additional protein structure between the envelope and the capsid. 

>NOTE: not all viruses contain a matrix

## Capsid 
Capsids are made of of multiple protein/ capsomer subunits 

>SYNONYM: The viral capsid is also referred to as a protein coat. 

### Icosahedral Capsid
The polypeptides making up the coat pack very specifically into the triangular faces of the icosahedron. 

#### Subunits
Each basic triangular subunit may consist of up to 3 different polypeptides, one at each vertex. 

### Evolution 
The Icosahedral protein capsid has evolved on many independent occasion in evolutionary history. The evolutionary advantage is that the icosahedron is a lowest energy structure, so is very stable.

#### Icosahedron Structure
An Icosahedron is a 3D structure with 30 identical equilateral triangular faces. Five faces form the top cap, five form the bottom cap and 5 form the middle ring.  The 20 faces are connected by 12 vertices. 

##### Symmetry 
An icosahedron has five fol symmetry when viewed axially, and 3 fold symmetry when viewed equatorially.

### Subunits
Subunits can be made up of several smaller identical or non identical polypeptides. 

## Envelope
The envelope consists of host derived bilipid membrane containing host and viral proteins/glycoproteins. Some viruses contain protein spikes which protrude from the membrane. 

### Function 
The envelope helps the virus evade the immune system as it appears similar to host cells. 

### Function 
The viral capsid functions to protect the viral genome, from physical and chemical damage or enzymatic degradation

## Nucleic Acid (Genome)
The nucleic acid genome may be DNA or RNA, single stranded or double stranded and linear or circular.

### Multipartate Viruses
Viruses with more than one nucleic acid molecule are called segmented/multipartate. These molecules are non redundant each containing different and vital parts of the viral genome. 

> NOTE: Most viruses contain only one nucleic acid molecule. 

> NOTE: multipartate viruses can swap nucleic acid molecules leading to recombination.
