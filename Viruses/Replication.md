# Viral Replication

## Host Specificity
Most viruses are specific to one host species. In multicellular hosts such as animals or plants most viruses can only replicate in one tissue/ cell type, such as influenza which is confined to respiratory tissue. Some viruses however can replicate in many different host species, such as HIV. 

The host range of a virus is determined in part by its ability to attach to and enter the host cell, which in turn is determined by the receptors on the host cell membrane. For example HIV uses the CD4 receptors of T memory cell to bind to and enter the cell. Without the right receptors on the cell membrane, the virus will be unable to infect the cell. The host must also contain the right cellular factors such as transcription and translation enzymes, to support viral replication. Small differences in the primary structure of enzymes, could render the virus unable to replicate within the cell.
