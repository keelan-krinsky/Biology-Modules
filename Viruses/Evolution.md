# Viral Evolution
Viruses have evolved on many time independently. Viruses evolve co-evolve with their hosts, when a host species becomes extinct so will its viruses. For example HIV evolved to recognise a receptor on human cells, by the adaption the cell receptor, Tetherin. Viruses may also evolve in their host for a long time before becoming infective, again human infection by HIV is an example. 

Viruses can evolve very fast due to their very short life cycle and high replication number. 

## Receptor Binding Proteins 
Viral membrane/capsid proteins mutate particularly fast, partly because of selective pressure supplied by the host immune system, and partly because of the evolutionary advantage conferred by more efficient entry into host cells.
