# One Step Growth Curve.
The One step growth curve is a lab technique used to calculate the burst size of a phage for a given host. Burst cell is normally between 50 and 400 depending on the specific phage and the specific host. 

## Process

### Step One 
The Phage is combined with the bacteria in the reaction solution such that; the concentration of phage in solution is known, the ratio of phage particles to bacterial particles (The multiplicity of infection) is sufficiently low that there is negligible change of 2 or more phage infecting one bacterium. 

### Step Two
The reaction is raised to a suitable reaction temperature, and periodically samples of the reaction mix are extract (every 6-87 minutes for a T4 phage) and treated with chloroform which causes bacterial cell lysis, stopping phage replication, and releasing all of the replicated phage still within the bacterial cells into solution.

### Step Three
For each chlorinated sample a number of dilutions are made. Theses dilutions are then mixed with a fresh bacterial culture and plated out.

### Step Four
The Petri Dishes are allowed some time to develop, and the number of plaques (clear spaces on the bacterial law is counted. 

## Calculations
It is assumed that each plaque corresponds to one plaque forming unit, i.e one phage. From this assumption, and the dilutions used the corresponding concentration of phage in the reaction solution is derived and plotted against the time from the start of reaction. When this value reaches its maximum, just before it again drops, then all phage originally introduced can be assumed to have undergone one replicative cycle and its progeny released into the solution. The ration between this maximum concentration and the initial concentration gives the number of new phage generated for each initial phage, and as only one phage infected each bacterium this ration gives the burst size of the phage.

## Phases 
### Eclipse phase
During the eclipse phase the phage is binding to and penetrating the host cells, and synthesis of viral proteins and genome has begun but as yet no new viral particles have been generated within the cell. The Phage count should drop to zero in this phase. 

### maturation Phase
In the maturation phase assembly, and release of phage has begun, and phage concentration rise rapidly.
