# Lysogenic Cycle
In the lysogenic cycle the phage DNA/genome is integrated into the host chromosome, and replicates with it. Once integrated into the host chromosome, the phage DNA is known as prophage. 

>NOTE: bacteria do have some defence against phages, in the form of restriction enzymes which recognise and cut up phage DNA.

## Life Cycle Switch
Phages in the lysogenic cycle do not cause cell lysis, Although some phages can switch back into the lytic life cycle. When prophage switches it is removed from the host chromosome, and may take some of the host cell genome with it, in specialised transduction. 

>NOTE: the removal of host genes from specialised transduction may be beneficial 


> NOTE: The entirely of the phage may not be cut out, or too much of host genome may be cut out with the phage, making the resulting nucleic acid molecule too large, the phage formed will be defective, with no evolutionary advantage.

### Stimuli
External stimuli, UV expose for example, may trigger the change to lytic replication.
