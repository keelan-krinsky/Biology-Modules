# Lytic Cycle
A phage which reproduces only by the lytic cycle is called a virulent phage.

## Attachment 
In the attachment phase, the phage attaches by its tail fibres to the cell wall of the host cell

## Penetration 
In the penetration phase, the phage excrete lysozyme to soften the cell wall, and then contracts its tail sheath to force the tail core (containing the phage nucleic acid) into the cell.

## Biosynthesis 
In the biosynthesis phase, phage DNA and phage proteins are produced en mass by host cell machinery.

##### Maturation 
In the maturation phase the phage particles assemble within the host cell. In the assembly process, phage nucleic acid enters the phage capsid. Although the mechanism for assembly is not well understood, it is clear that errors can occur in the process. 

NOTE: The phage genome must be sufficiently small to fit within the phage capsid, however there is some leeway, and occasionally some host DNA may also be packaged along with phage nucleic acid.

## Release
In the release phase the phage again releases lysozyme to break down/ soften the cell wall, and moves out of the cell.
