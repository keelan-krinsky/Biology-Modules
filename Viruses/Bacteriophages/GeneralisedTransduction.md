# Imports

# Generalised Transduction
Occasionally, during phage replication, some of the host genome, also gets cut up enzymatically, and some of it is packaged within the new virions. This host DNA can be inserted into another bacterium, when the phage infects this new bacterium. Recombination may take place to integrate this new DNA into the host genome, or the new DNA may remain separate as a plasmid. 

>NOTE: Conjugation also be function to transfer DNA.
