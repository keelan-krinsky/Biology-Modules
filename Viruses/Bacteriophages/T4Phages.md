# Imports

# T4 Phages.

## Morphology
T4 phages are icosahedral

## Constituents

### Nucleic acid
The T4 phage contains dsDNA 

### Sheath
The phage tail is covered by a glycoprotein layer. 

##### Tail fibers. 
The composition of these fibers is not well conserved across all T even phages. 

>NOTE: As the cell wall of all gram positive bacteria are all more or less the same bacteriophage bonding is not very specific, the deciding factor is whether the bacteria has the necessary machinery to facilitate phage replication.
