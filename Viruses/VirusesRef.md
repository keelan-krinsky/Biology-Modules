# Viruses

## Background
All viruses are acellular obligate parasites. Some viruses can survive for a long period outside host cells, but no viruses can replicate independently of a host cell. This is because the translation system of the cell is required for viral replication. 

> NOTE: Viruses should always be referred to as replicating and not reproducing, to differentiate replications as a externally dependant process. 

># Virion Constituents
>
>## Matrix
>The matrix is an additional protein structure between the envelope and the capsid. 
>
>>NOTE: not all viruses contain a matrix
>
>## Capsid
>Capsids are made of of multiple protein/ capsomer subunits 
>
>>SYNONYM: The viral capsid is also referred to as a protein coat. 
>
>### Icosahedral Capsid
>The polypeptides making up the coat pack very specifically into the triangular faces of the icosahedron. 
>
>#### Subunits
>Each basic triangular subunit may consist of up to 3 different polypeptides, one at each vertex. 
>
>### Evolution
>The Icosahedral protein capsid has evolved on many independent occasion in evolutionary history. The evolutionary advantage is that the icosahedron is a lowest energy structure, so is very stable.
>
>#### Icosahedron Structure
>An Icosahedron is a 3D structure with 30 identical equilateral triangular faces. Five faces form the top cap, five form the bottom cap and 5 form the middle ring.  The 20 faces are connected by 12 vertices. 
>
>##### Symmetry
>An icosahedron has five fol symmetry when viewed axially, and 3 fold symmetry when viewed equatorially.
>
>### Subunits
>Subunits can be made up of several smaller identical or non identical polypeptides. 
>
>## Envelope
>The envelope consists of host derived bilipid membrane containing host and viral proteins/glycoproteins. Some viruses contain protein spikes which protrude from the membrane. 
>
>### Function
>The envelope helps the virus evade the immune system as it appears similar to host cells. 
>
>### Function
>The viral capsid functions to protect the viral genome, from physical and chemical damage or enzymatic degradation
>
>## Nucleic Acid (Genome)
>The nucleic acid genome may be DNA or RNA, single stranded or double stranded and linear or circular.
>
>### Multipartate Viruses
>Viruses with more than one nucleic acid molecule are called segmented/multipartate. These molecules are non redundant each containing different and vital parts of the viral genome. 
>
>> NOTE: Most viruses contain only one nucleic acid molecule. 
>
>> NOTE: multipartate viruses can swap nucleic acid molecules leading to recombination. 
>
>

># Virion Structure
>
>## Size
>Viruses have a very large size range, from about $50nm-1\mu m$ in length/diameter. For example rabies virus is $70-170nm$, whereas Ebola is about 970nm.
>
>>NOTE: This size range implies that viruses are 10-100 times smaller than bacterial cells, and $10^3-10^4$ times smaller than eukaryotic cells. 
>
>### Icosahedral Viruses
>As the structure of an icosahedral virus is very set, size can only be increased by increasing the size of triangular constituents, (while maintaining their equilateral shape), or by the formation of larger (equilateral) triangular subunits from four smaller one. Increasing size of the basic triangular subunits implies increasing the size of the polypeptide(s) which they consist of. 
>
>
>## Shape
>Overall virion shape is quite diverse, but the majority of virion have an icosahedral shape. 
>
>### Enveloped viruses
>Virions which posses an outer envelope are polymorphic due to the fluid nature of the bilipid layer. 
>
>### Icosahedral
>Icosahedral viruses contain an icosahedral capsid, that is a capsid consisting of 20 equilateral triangular faces, fitted together to form an icosahedron. 
>
>### Helical
>Helical viruses contain a helical/rod shaped capsid, This capsid may be long and thin or short and thick. Furthermore they may be flexible folding into loops and coils. 
>
>>NOTE: Most helical viruses are ssRNA Viruses.
>
>## Internal Organisation
>All virions contain a capsid. Some virions, additionally contain an envelope which surrounds the capsid. Within the protein coat, and often associated with it s the nucleic acid molecule(s) of the virus. 
>
>### Nucleic acid
>The nucleic acid forms has a helical secondary structure with a ball like tertiary structure. An electrostatic interactions between the nucleic acid backbone and the capsid/matrix protein hold maintains this tertiary structure and holds the nucleic acid molecule in place. 


># Viral Evolution
>Viruses have evolved on many time independently. Viruses evolve co-evolve with their hosts, when a host species becomes extinct so will its viruses. For example HIV evolved to recognise a receptor on human cells, by the adaption the cell receptor, Tetherin. Viruses may also evolve in their host for a long time before becoming infective, again human infection by HIV is an example. 
>
>Viruses can evolve very fast due to their very short life cycle and high replication number. 
>
>## Receptor Binding Proteins
>Viral membrane/capsid proteins mutate particularly fast, partly because of selective pressure supplied by the host immune system, and partly because of the evolutionary advantage conferred by more efficient entry into host cells. 
>

## Classification
Bacteria are not classified on the tree of life, but are still classified into family (written in italics, with a capital and ending in viridae). 

### Viral species.
A group of viruses sharing the same genetic information and ecological niche (i.e. the host). Common names are used for species, subspecies are designated by a number. 
Do not reproduction, and have no phylogenetic trees (a tree showing evolutionary relationships based on homology of nucleic acids and amino acids). 

Viral species are host specific so are not related to each other. 

NOTE: every living host currently on the planet has a associated virus. 

For example HIV, is a species, there is HIVI and HIVII which both infect humans but are completely different species, within a species there are different strains/subspecies/subtypes within a species,which have amino acid or genomic variation. 

NOTE: viruses cannot be classified by morphology either. Also as they have arisen many times during evolution there is not common ancestor.

For example, _Herpesviridae_ is the family, _Herpesvirus_ is the genus, Human herpes virus (is the species), subtypes HHV-1 HHV-2, HHV-3. 
_Retroviridae_, _Lentivirus_, human immunodeficiency virs, HIVI (lost of subtypes), HIVII (constrained to particular location in west Africa).

HIV is a very fast mutating virus, (variation of about 18\%), different host immune systems will but different evolutionary pressure on the virus to evolve.

The amount of similarity required for viruses to be classified as a different species, depends on the virus itself. 

NOTE: Classification can also be based on pathogenic character. 

### Characteristics used for classification
Viruses are devided into different taxonomic groups based on several features

### Genomics
80\% RNA 20\% DNA. classified by type of nucleic acids RNA/DNA, and doulbe/single stranded. 

#### Double stranded DNA
Tend to be very large. The largest virus is small pox. 

#### Single stranded
Very small 

#### Single stranded RNA
There are two types 

#### Megaviruses, gyruses.
Discovered about 15 years ago, (should they be viruses or a whole new domain, they contain dsDNA, )

#### dsDNA
with a RNA intermediate, copied back to DNA. 
COntain hepatisis virus. 

#### Retroviruses
Single stranded RNA, copies itself into dsDNA using reverse transcriptase, which then integrates into the DNA of the cell, (which makes it very hard to recognise. 

### Host
### Shape
### Presence of envelope
### Transcription mechanism in the host

NOTE: dsDNA replicates the same way as in cells. 

There are seven groups, ssDNA, dsDNA, dsRNA, + sense ssRNA, -ve sense RNA ssRNA reverse transcribing virus with DNA intermediates, dsDNA with RNA intermediates. 

NOTE: virus is classified based on the nucleic acid within the virion. 

### Baltimore Classification Scheme
COPY IMAGE. 

NOTE: remember RNA viruses have genes, some can translate directly, some require some form of intermediate. 
NOTE: viruses tend not have introns. 

### Summary
viruses are composed of portiens nucelic acids and sometimes a lipid envelope, 
there are two basic symetries helical and icosohedral (polyherdal, for larger vieuses)
Viral caposids are mode up of portien subunits or capsomere s which fold to form specific structures. Genomes within viruses capos are lieat or circular RNA/DNA which are folded and interact with the capsid proteins through electronstatic or hydrophobic interactinos. 
Viable virus particles or viruses are infectious.Viruses have multiple origins and co-evolved with their hosts. 
viruses are classified according to the expression (mRNA) of their genes. 
 

## Life cycle.

### Attachment
The virus has to attach to the host

### Inject DNA
### Transcribe
Make viral proteins important for replication. These proteins interact with the host cell, dirrecting it to replicate the virus, transcribe it and package it. Each protein can have many functions. 

### Replication
### Late transcription.
### Packaging
### Maturation phase
### Exit

#### Lysis
bursts the host cell open

#### Exocytosis
bud out of the membrane by exocytosis. 

Some insert into host DNA. 

NOTE prac is on the one step growth curve. 

NOTE: there is a difference between generalised and specialised transduction, 

## Generalised transduction.
normally beneficial to the bacteria recieving the new bacterial DNA. 

## Culture of viruses.
because viruses need a living host, a living host is required, this can be a tissue or a cell culture. (cells separated from tissue and placed in a growth medium). 

dedifferentiated cell lines are immortalised, there is an immortalised cell line, hela (henriety lax) cells, taken from ovary tissue. had several children and eveloped the most virulent form of overian cancer ever seen, lead to a debate over who has control over other people cells.

Growing viruses. viruses kept in living cells, which form monolayer. plant cells require removing the cell wall, to form protoplasts, or the cells can be separated with still their cell walls by dissolving the middle lamella. 

normally cows or horses are used, and cells separated by physical and enzymatic treatment, the cells are then placed in the culture medium. 

# Growing viruses in the lab.

## model systems are often used such as mice, chimps, rabbits, primates.

NOTE: limitations of a model.

## Isolating phage
The host is required for growth 

macromolecues can be separated by size charge or density. enveloped viruses (and other cellulart  organelles can often be seartated according to their buoyant density (eg viruses with large membranes are lesss dense than those with smaller envelopes proteins or nculeic acid will be much denser. as viruses are less dense  a high speed centrifuge is required, density gradient centrifugation is also used (for example using a gradient of sucrose concentrations).

The virus particles will band/float according to theur respective equilibrium buoyan density, the electron microscope can be used to check the virus is their, long flexible viruses may break up in centrifugation. to get DNA or RNA out oif the capsid use proteases. Gel electrophorsis is used to separate out nucleic acids. 

## Ratezonal centrifugation
form of differential centrifugatrion based on size of particles, which allows for raod fractionation and purification of subcellular particles (e.g. organelles, virions). the largest particels will sediment most rapidly or under the least force, eg in an infected cell organelles mictochondria will sedimant first the viruses then ribosomes, in the case of a very big viruses serpation may come out with microsomal fraction and plasma membrane so density gradient may be required to separate virus. 

Electromicroscopy, stain with a heavy metal, prep grid and bombard with electrons. 

Virus Identification 
when viruses infect the cell a pathology has occured, the symptoms is what is see but the abnormalities of the cells themselves is a cytopathic effect. serological test (proiteins) based on the principal of the specificity of binding of an antibody to specific antigen viral antigen detect antibodies against virusees or virus-infected cells, 

antibodies bind to  specific epitopes of the proteins of the virues, protein capsids are different between different groups of viruses. (antigenic implies interacts with an antibody). ELISA, or used antibodies to identify viruses in neutraliztion test such as viral hemagglutination or complement fixation tests,
Enzyme linked immunosorbent assya ISEM or western plots.ELISA is being replaced by PCR, as it is quicker and more sensitive. 

Nucleic acids 
hybridization (Southern blot) based on the principal that two complementary strands will bind to each other 

based Polymerase chaing reaction (PCR) based on the exponential amplification of DNA by heat stable DNA polymerase. 

western blots and ELISA are the two most common methods used to identify viruses in the lab. 

### Cytopathic effects.
cells form monolayer joined by connective tissue, once virus is added to the cells the cells round up, whcihc is very common for many viruses. The nucleic also swell. becuase of all the replication processes required. 

Electron mciroscope heavy emtal gives dark stain around the virus, revealing its shape, viruses incubated with specific antibody, ie antibody added to homogenate. heavy die then bonds to AB-virus body forming a thick died complex, the viruses which do not bind must be of a different type, this process is ISEM immunosorbent electron microscopy. 

recently it has become much easier to detect nucleic acid then the protein coat, by PCR, 

### PCR
design primer (18-25 nucleotides annealing temp) homologous to required DNA
Denature DNA 92
anneal primer, (45-60C)  extension 72C, Repeat the 3 cycles about 35 times. 

to differentiate between different strains a nonconserved region must be used however for larger groups conseved regions must ber used for RNA C-DNA synthesis Reverse transcriptase is required, 

NOTE: PCR is not replication but amplification, as it is an exponential process. so in theory only one piece of DNA is required, and in practise still only a small amount of DNA. 



find western blot and ELISA, 

### Southern blot.
COPY from slide, 
SB is based on the principal of hybridizationi of two complementary homologous DNA strands. ss DNA test fragments are run on a gel, transffered to a nitrocellulose membrane and then incubated in a solution containing the probe (known complementary ssDNA sequencce), labelled with radioactive or flourecent nucleotides) eg Alpha -32P-dCTP 
unbound nucleotides are washed off and if the two strains hybridise they are detected using an autoradiography film, if no hybridisation takes palce then the test sample is not related to the probe.
southern blot is used to detect DNA, (RNA is northern blots). protein run on gel instead of DNA, DNA transfered out of gel onto membrane, specific DNA probes (slightly longer than primers ) are used. the probe is complimentary to a small region of the viral DNA, (so the sequence of the virus must be known). ethidium bromide or ther stain used and flourecent light. the probe is radioactively labelled, (labelled probe is "hot"). visualising binding.

for rpobe to bind viral DNA must be denatured. 
southern blot proceedure, COPY IMAGE, 

DNA run on gel, (sometimes cleave DNA first if large), gel placed above alkaline solution in platform and covered by nitrocellulose membrane, with filter paper above it, the alkaline solution moves up by capillary action passively, or an electrode can be used to speed up the process. Nitrocellulose combined with probe (hybridised.) nitrocellulose then wasted so if probe has nto bound then no bands seen on the autoradiogram.

# Unresolved

## Rhabdoviridae
Such viruses are ssRNA negative stranded. Single stranded RNA- lyssavirus is an example which causes rabies.
