# Virion Structure 

## Size
Viruses have a very large size range, from about $50nm-1\mu m$ in length/diameter. For example rabies virus is $70-170nm$, whereas Ebola is about 970nm.

>NOTE: This size range implies that viruses are 10-100 times smaller than bacterial cells, and $10^3-10^4$ times smaller than eukaryotic cells. 

### Icosahedral Viruses
As the structure of an icosahedral virus is very set, size can only be increased by increasing the size of triangular constituents, (while maintaining their equilateral shape), or by the formation of larger (equilateral) triangular subunits from four smaller one. Increasing size of the basic triangular subunits implies increasing the size of the polypeptide(s) which they consist of. 


## Shape 
Overall virion shape is quite diverse, but the majority of virion have an icosahedral shape. 

### Enveloped viruses
Virions which posses an outer envelope are polymorphic due to the fluid nature of the bilipid layer. 

### Icosahedral
Icosahedral viruses contain an icosahedral capsid, that is a capsid consisting of 20 equilateral triangular faces, fitted together to form an icosahedron. 

### Helical 
Helical viruses contain a helical/rod shaped capsid, This capsid may be long and thin or short and thick. Furthermore they may be flexible folding into loops and coils. 

>NOTE: Most helical viruses are ssRNA Viruses.

## Internal Organisation
All virions contain a capsid. Some virions, additionally contain an envelope which surrounds the capsid. Within the protein coat, and often associated with it s the nucleic acid molecule(s) of the virus. 

### Nucleic acid
The nucleic acid forms has a helical secondary structure with a ball like tertiary structure. An electrostatic interactions between the nucleic acid backbone and the capsid/matrix protein hold maintains this tertiary structure and holds the nucleic acid molecule in place.
