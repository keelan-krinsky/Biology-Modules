# Virion Assembly
Viruses must pack viral proteins inside the capsid, but very little is known about the mechanism. The mechanisms of nucleic acid packaging is also poorly understood, and can differ between different viral species/clades. In some viral species the capsid assembles around the viral nucleic acid, in others, first then capsid is formed, and then the nucleic acid is forced into it. The capsid proteins.

### Capsid Formation
Capsomers assemble together through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions to from the capsid. 

#### Helical Viruses
The nucleic acid of the virus naturally forms a helix, and the capsid proteins packaging around the helix. The origin of helix formation is usually at one end of the nucleic acid molecule within capsid formation proceeding in one direction only. Sometimes, however, capsid formation may start at the middle of the nucleic acid and from outwards from both ends.

In the assembly of the capsid the capsid proteins first form into disk structure, due to pH and possible other drivers. The nucleic acid is then threaded into this disk, and as the disk grows upwards it pulls the nucleic acid upwards through the disk into the interior of the newly formed capsid.As the nucleic acid is pulled up into the capsid it takes on its normal helical shape. At the end of capsid formation the 5- end of the nucleic acid molecule is pulled up through the loop. 

### Envelope formation 
The envelope is formed from the host cell, cell membrane in the process of virion exocytosis. Viral proteins move into the envelop after the virus has budded out of the host cell.
