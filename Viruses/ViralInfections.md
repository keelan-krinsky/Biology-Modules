title: "Viral Infections"
---

the symptoms/disease is a manifestation of the viral replication/transcription, and the response of the immune system. The effect in this the cell, cytopathic, viruses include three classes or antibodies,IgG IgM and IgA, IgG is the most important. Their function is to neutralise the virus. IgA is the most active at the mucosal surfaces. IgG is most active in the blood. 

Cell mediated response. 

NK cells, which are nonspecific. 

Cytotoxic CD8 cells provide the strongest response. 

## Barriers to virus
The skin,the mucosal membrane of the eye, the genetically tract, through nose, alimentary canal. 

## Spread
many viruses come from wild animals, especially rather nasty ones such as HIV. As such theses animals can act as vectors/carries of the virus. Many viruses live in plants or food (enteroviruses are viruses of then gut). Viruses can also be found in water, rotoviruses causes diarrhea in children from Braammfontein straight. Must be UV resistant to survive in water or soil, theses viruses have very special envelopes. Aerosol viruses rely on a very high rate of infection, that is very many particles are produced as very few particles will ever find or host or effectively infect it. Rabies carried by dogs and mosquitoes carry disease. Vertical transmission is from mother to child, via breast feeding or through the urogenital tract. Some viruses remain localised such a papilloma which cases warts. Most viruses spread systemically through the blood. Herpes 2 through urethra of virginal, herpes 1 can be through saliva. Spreads to the central nervous system to lymph glands, can Be triggered by stress on the host or UV light (targets the central nervous system). Some viruses infect the membranes of the brain causing encephalitis. Some viruses only replicate in one type of cell,some can infect multiply types generally tissue specific called topo?

## Immune response
A good immune system will stop viral replication faster. Symptoms can be directly related to the response of the host and the replication activity of the virus. There is a balance between removing virus and providing evolutionary pressure for mutation. Not all viruses cause very severe effects in there replication, polioviruses damage certain nervous system. Picornaviruses causes lysis.

Viruses ability to persist is also dependant on the immunosuppression abilities,such as down regulation of MHC1 proteins. Herpes will suppress its own activity. UV light causes DNA damage which is related to DNA repair which tends to trigger viral replication.


### Types of infection

#### Abortive infection 
infects cell, but cannot replicate within the cell


#### acute infection
by the times symptoms develop there is already lots of virus, after immune response no virus remains.

#### Chronic infection
the body never clears the virus completely for example hepatitis B. In about 10\% of cases the viruses is never removed, although it does adapt its pathicity to have slightly less dramatic effect. Such individuals are carriers and can infect other people through exposure to infected blood. Often persistent infections result fro DIs defective interfering particles. Sometimes the virus takes up a defective particle, and replicates it, this additional replication makes viral inefficient so keeps viral numbers low which makes them less pathogenic and hence more likely to be persistent. Latent viruses, hide in the host DNA. HIV is also a latent virus. Viral infections can persist over a long period of time, once it is activated the vast majority of individuals then get AIDS and die. Herpes virus keeps going between latent and virulent. 

### Emerging Infectious diseases
About 40\% pf viruses from environment. Of those known 75\% of viruses are from wildlife. Most emerging infectious diseases are bacteria. Many viruses which infect humans come from intermediate hosts. Emerging viruses can be migration of animals because of fires,or deforestation. The sate of the population affects emerging diseases, the number of people getting HIV in SA is decreasing but the age of infection is decreasing due to sex at younger age at schools. Ecotourism leads to viral transmission,urbanisation with people living in closer proximity leads to more transmission. Bat and bird diseases from feces, common in markets in the far east. 

## Orthomyxoviridae 
Influenza belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae it is a negative sense single strand virus.It is enveloped and has multiple RNA strands. Envelope. Genetic diversity as it can swap nucleic acid segments around with other viruses. The advantage of a segmented genome is more genetic flexibility. Getting al seven segment into capsid is impressive. There is a matrix, spikes on the envelope. One type of spike is hemagglutinin another is neuraminidase (helps to break down the host membrane). Antibodies are made against these protruding parts, so these spikes are mutated the fastest. All RNA segments replicate separately and all are required for infection. Only partially uncoat so as to protect itself. 

### Influenza epidemics
Influenza has killed more people that HIV, as particular virus with a combination of mutations can be quite lethal also can cause death in young children with defective or unformed immune systems, or old people where the immune system is starting to break down. Wide host range, birds, (Influenza A) ducks pigs wild cats. When virus goes through alternative host can mutate and recombine RNA segments. Swapping a whole segment (must be the same segment number) re-assortment,can potentially lead to a lethal combination, also changes antigenicity. Most of the time shifts are relatively minor, every now and then there is a major change, leading to dramatically increased pathicity. 

### History 
First influenza was identified in 1889, mutation lead to Spanish flu epidemic,started in Baltimore, US soldiers brought it to Spain. More people died in this epidemic then any other epidemic. Due to the war there was poor nutrition and sanitation. In 1968 there was a shift to the Hong Kong flue epidemic. Avian flu and swine flu after that.(shift in 1957 as well)

Re-assortment between pig and avian variety often causes major antigenic shift.

Michigan flu, particular combination in 2017, epidemic died down quickly. Glycoproteins are...

Naming 
Type Ã€ or B/ Place of origin/first isolate identified/ year/ subtype. (type of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase). If the strain is non human in origin this will be added to the nomenclature. 

Antigenic shift is recombination, drift is mutation. chirmeric viruses after virus meeting.

Viruses occur in a population of variation, (variation around a master sequence)

Genetic bottleneck. Changing host presents a major bottleneck and may lead to large charges in the host. 

## HIV 
lentivirus (slow).highly pathogenic, crosses the species barrier (zoonosis). HIV! Is a collection of evolutionary linked clades based ob the nucleotides sequence of the gag of envelope genes. 9717 nt long 16 proteins. 

HIV is a ssRNA virus, HIV carries in its capsid two identical pieces of the genome. Requires 2RNAses to kick start reverse transcription. 

COPY OUT ALL PROTEINS 
spike contains two proteins. 
Integrate, and reverse transcriptase proteins are carried. 
HIV uses tRNA as a primer, to start replication. Uses host polymerase.transcribed in the same way as other cellular genes. 

In plant viruses methylation sometimes occurs. 
Transcribes three regulator proteins at the end of genome 

#### tat protein
regulates transcription 

#### Rev regulates the balance between replicative and structural proteins. 

### Life cycle 
Invaginates by endocytosis, and the only partially uncoats. 

Integrates, normally only integrates once. (cant make lots of DNA from single RNA). Integrates more or less randomly although there may be hot spots. Must package two identical strands. 

Theoretically infection with two strands could give recombination with Diffs ssRNA strands in one virion. 

Particular subtypes are generally localised to geographic regions where they are dominant.
Huge genetic variability.

Vaccines against one strain may not be as effective against others. (not good IgG response in general). Window period HIV is multiplying but no symptoms yet. Then there is primary immune response, feel sick, flu like systems. Lots of antibodies and white blood cells. Depending on the  immune system the plateau/ amount of residue Plasma viral concentration. When it plateaus out at a lower level the plateau period will last longer. Finally body cant keep virus latent and it replicates like crazy T cells start die when T drops under 200 cells per $\mu L$ then it drops below 200. Antiretroviral drugs can suppress HIV so that it.

### Prevention 
sexual behaviour, 

### Antiretroviral drugs HAART
nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Non-nucleotide RT inhibitors. Protease inhibitors. Intergrase inhibitors, receptor blocking
must be taken on strict time schedule. 

Vaccines, prevention better than cure. 2 types prevention and postinfection to control infection after you have HIV.the changes of completely prevention is very unlikely. Treatment with vaccines to keep viruses low. Stem cell research to produce T cells to replenish T cells lost from HIV, these are treatments not cure
