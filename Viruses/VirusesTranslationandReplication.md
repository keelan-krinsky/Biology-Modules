# Imports

# Virus Translation
Viruses do not translate themselves they are replicated by the cell. 

## Background

## Proteins
the proteins produced can be broadly catogorised into proteins which facilitate cell take over and transcription, and structural proteins whichmake up the virion.
the proteins geared for transcripition are synthesises in early stage translation. 

Theses proteins are moved around using the cytoskeleton, and endoplasmic reticulum/golgi apparatus.


In a DNA viruses one a common cytopathogoy is swelling of the nucelus. 

## RNA 

### ssRNA 

#### +ve sense
undergoes transcripition to make RNA polymerase as soon as it inters the cell, the negative/ intermedaite strand is used to make lots of copies of the viral genome strand, which is used for tranlation, and is incapsidated to form new virions. 

### -ve sense
the negative strand is used to make positive intermediate, which is used to many negative/genome strands which are then encapsulated. 

## Retroviruses. 
retroviruses first replicate ssRNA into dsDNA which integrates into the host genome, forming provirus. the host DNA dependant RNA polymerase is then used to transcribe the provirus to form viral genome, and mRNA for viral protein synthesis. 

provirus is not integrated ranadomly into the host DNA, HIV signal to cell to cause replication. retroviruses can only treanscribe and translate fromt he provirus. i


## DNA viruses 
DNA Viruses replicate in the nucleus, and use host DNA dependant DNA polymerase. (there is one exception which replicates in the cytoplasm.)

### Life Cycle
DNA polymerase copies genome to complimentary/intermediate straond. thisintermediate stgrand is then used as the template to make many copies of the original gemone DNA strand 

Viruses attatches to host cell, attatching to the receptors, 

#### Exiting cell
The virus the exits the cell,either by excotysis if it contains a membrane or lysis if it does not.

## Bidirectional transcription
lots of dsDNA viruses use both strands as templates for transcription, efficient as they have such small genomes. 

### dsDNA
copies both strands, usually using the semiconservative replication method.(leadingand lagging strand with okazaki fragments etc.). 

## RNA viruses  
host? RNA dependant RNA polymerase.

> NOTE only partially uncoat, to avoid enzymatic degradation by the host. 

### ssRNA viruses
For example pacorna virus. RNA viruses use their own encoded RNA polymerase, which is an RNA dependant RNA polymerase called replicase. 
however many other cellular factors are still required for replication, and operatiion of replicase. The Nonstructural porteins of the virus help to switch between transcription and translation of the viral genome. tend to be smaller with only on transcription phase.

dsRNA viruses
bind two pieces of RNA together, strand are separated and copied semiconservatively (it is though.)

one early transcription gene keeps the virus in the latent transcriptionphase. 


> NOTE: both replicase and transcriptase are RNA dependant RNA polymerases, encoded by the RNA virus.


# Virus Replication and Transcription

## DNA viruses 

### Replication 

#### Location
Occurs in the Nucleus

#### Enzymes 
Host DNA dependant DNA polymerase

> NOTE: There is one exception which replicates in the cytoplasm.

#### Process
DNA polymerase is used to copy the DNA strand genome to complimentary/intermediate strand. This intermediate strand is then used as the template to make many copies of the original gemone DNA strand 

Viruses attatches to host cell, attatching to the receptors, 

#### Exiting cell
The virus the exits the cell,either by excotysis if it contains a membrane or lysis if it does not.

## Bidirectional transcription

### +ve sense 

#### Translation

Positive sense viruses have modifications at the 5' and 3' end so look like mRNA and can translate directly.

### Replication

#### Location 
Replication occurs in the cytoplasm

#### Enzymes 
Viral RNA dependant RNA Polymerase 

### -ve sense

#### Translation 
The -ve stand is not transcribed directly, rather the complimentary strand is used for translation. 

### Translation
Some small RNA viruses are translated directly by host machinery, and a long single protein is produced, referred to as a polyprotein. The polyprotein is then cleaved into fragments/polypeptides by protease. The protease may be host or viral depending on the virus. Some RNA viruses make a protein from the 5' end of the genome during early transcription, and use 3' end to make capsid proteins, such viruses are often slightly larger. 

#### Subjenomic
there is a small piece of RNA which is first replicated by RNA dependant RNA polymerase the complimentary strandis capped and poly A tail is added. This complimentary strand is then transcribed. 

> NOTE viral proteins are multifunctional. 

### dsRNA viruses
bind two pieces of RNA together, strand are separated and copied semiconservatively (it is though.)
### Retroviruses
one early transcription gene keeps the virus in the latent transcriptionphase. 


> NOTE: both replicase and transcriptase are RNA dependant RNA polymerases, encoded by the RNA virus.
