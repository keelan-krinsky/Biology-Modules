# Electrophoresis

## Background.
Electro refers to the flow of electrons/current.
Phoresis refers to moviment (of sample elements)

### Definitions
Electrophoresis is a separation method where by charged molecules in solution, most commonly proteins of nucliec acids, migrate in respose to an electric field.


NOTE: As Electrophoresis is the moviment (of sample consitituents) under electric current,electrophoresis can only be used as a separation technique for molelecules which will move within an electric field ie charged molecules.

#### Cathode
The cathode is the negatively charged electrode. Cations (positively charged ions) will be attracted to and move towards the cathode during elecrophoresis.

#### Anode.
The anode is the positively charged electrode. Anions (negatively charged ions) will move towards the anode during electrophoresis.

### History
Arne tiselius.
nobel chemistry prize for electrophoresis and adsorbtion analysis, especially complex nature of ther serum proteins.

#### Cell
bend glass tube with electrolyte reservior containing cathode and anode, and a buffer containing sample molecules to be separated.
Horse serum tested gave four different bands. Albumin and 3 globulins ($\alpha, \beta \text{ and } \gamma$).


## Rate of migration

### Affecting fators

#### Field Strength.
Higher field strength will lead to faster moviment but it may also in turn heat up the gel destroying its structure.


#### Net charge (sample molecules)
#### Size
Smaller molecules will move faster as they have an easier path through the gel.

#### Shape
More spherical molecules will move faster and then linear molecules of the same molecular wieght, as they will be able to move through pores regardless fo their orientation. linear molecules will have to line up correctly (with their long side more of less purpendicular to the pore), to be able to pass through the pore.

supercoiled nucleic acids will migrate faster.

#### media/solution porperties.

##### Ionic strength
Higher ionic strength will lead to more shielding and hence slower moviment (?)

##### Viscosity
Higher viscosity will result in slowr moviment through the gel.

##### Temperature.
Higher temperature (provided the structure of sample consitiuets is not disrupted) will lead to faster moviment through the gel.

#### Voltage
#### Intercalculating dyes.
### Equation

$\mu=\frac{qE}{r}$

where:

  $\mu$=Mobility
  q= net charge
  E= field strength ($V.cm^{-1}$)
  r= molecular radius

NOTE: r is also commonly reffered to as frictional coefficient f, and is dependant on size.

#### Relating resistance, voltage, current, and power.

##### Ohms law
$V=IR$

Increased voltage with constant resistance increases current.
Increased current leads to increased heat which must be dissapated or it will be absorbed by the system. Too much heat can cause the sample to migrate irregularly within the sample lane, leading to sample bands which form a "smile", in the extreme case the gel can literally fall apart.


##### Power
$P=IV$ ($P=I^2R$)

## Set up
Slab gel electrophoresis can be performed ither horizontally or vertically. If run vertically samples are introduced into the wells at the top of the gel.


NOTE: In electrophoresis one parameter,  resistance, voltage, current, or power is always held constant.

##### Constant current
Velocity of molecules is constant, but heat is generated.

NOTE: velocty is dirrectly proportional to current.

##### Constant voltage
velocity will slow (over the course of the reaction), but heat is generated.

##### Constant Power.
Velocity slows, but heat generated is kept constant.


## Set up
Slab gel electrophoresis can be performed ither horizontally or vertically. If run vertically samples are introduced into the wells at the top of the gel.

### Electrode
The negative electrode is black. the positive electrode is red.

### Wells
The well are created by inserting a comb into the set up before the gel is set. Once the gel is set the comb can be removed, leaving evenly sized, evenly spaced wells where the teeth of the comb used to be.

#### Regular comb
The wells are separated by an "ear" of gel

#### Houndstooth comb
The wells are immediataely adjacent.

### Gel

#### Function
The solid support matrix inhibits convection and diffusion which would otherwise impede separation of molecules, and allows for a permanent record of the results. It can provide additional separation (by size) through molecular sieving.

NOTE: A perminant record is made through staining after running, and trichloroacetic acid which acts as a fixing agent for proteins.

#### Structure
Both agarose and polyacrilamide gels are porous in structre. A porous gel acs as a sieve by retarding or, in some cases, by completely obstructing the movment of macromolecules while allowing smaller molecules to migrate freely. A gel with a restrictive pore size can differentiate sample molecules based on size. Both gel types are also relatively electrically neutral.

### Polyacrylamide.
Polyacrylamide is a cross-linked polymer of arcylamide. It can be used to separate molecules from 0.2-500kD, eg most proteins and oligonucleotides.

NOTE: Acrylamide is a potent neurotoxin.

### Concentration
Polyacilamide gels\% are made at 3.5-20\% by mass.

### Agarose.

#### Structure
Agarose is a polysaccharide, harvested from rhodophyceae algal cell walls. Alternating sugar units form linear chains. These two subunits are $1,3-\beta-d-\text{galactose}$ and $1,4-\alpha-3,6-\text{anhydrogalactose}$. These chains are cross-linked via hydrogen bonding to form the porous matrix. Cooling a liquid form of the gel forms a matrix with an 'average' pore size.

To make the gel, a solid sample of agarose, in a random structure is heated from menting from $45-100^\circ C$, the inital gel structure begins to form as unifrom cooling takes place, and by the time the gel has cooled back to room structure it has taken on its final porous conformation. Agarose gel will dissolve again if immerced in boiling water only solidifying when the temperature is lowered to about $40^\circ C$

The pore size of the gel can be predetermined but by adjusting the cencentration of agarose in the gel.

Agarose gels are fragile as they are hydrocolliods and they are held together by the formation of weak hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions.

NOTE: heat can break these H bonds breaking the matrix apart.


#### Function
Used for separating large molecules 8-800,000kD. Agarose is effective at separating these larger molecules, such as nucleic acids and protein complexes because of its larger pore size.


#### Concentration
Agarose gels are made to be 0.5-5\% agarose by mass.

### Buffer
In most electrophoresis units the gel is mounted between two buffer chambers containing separate electrodes so that the onyl electrical connnection between the two chambers is through the gel.

#### Function
The function of buffer is to carry current and protect samples.

#### Types
 #. Tris Borate EDTA (TBE).
 #. Acetate EDTA (TAE).
 #. Tris Phosphate EDTA (TPE) used most often for DNA.
 #. 10mM sodium phosphate buffer: used for RNA.

Buffer additives can also modify sample molecules such as (denaturing agents)

### Dye
Tracking dye is loaded to keep track of the moviment of sample consituents on the gel, the tracking dye is visible during the electrophoresis process and moves just ahead of the samples.

### Loading adgent/dye
The loading adjent or density agent is used to to weigh down the sample so that it remains in the wells, and does not move through the buffer above the gel.

## Detection
Bands are ditected on the gel by staining during or after electrophoresis using a number of different stains.

### Stains

#### Ethidium Bromide
Ethidium Bromide is used to mark double stranded DNA. It is flourescent under UV light.  

#### SyBr green or Sybr gold.
Used to stain single or double stranded DNA, or for RNA.

#### Silver stain
Siler stain is a more sensitive tha the SyBr gells but is also used for single or double stranded DNA or for RNA, or even for proteins.

#### Coomassie blue
Commassie blue is used for proteins.

## Interpretation
Molecular weight markers, using fragments of known size are run along side sample for comparison. A semiquantitive measure can also be obtained by comparison of band intensity.


## Proteins
The net charge on proteins is derrived from amino and carboxylic groups on it sode chains and terminals.

### Charge

#### PH
Charge is dependant on pH as R groups of the protein will posses different charges based on the pH of the solution. The exact responce of a given protein to PH change will depend on the particular amino acids which make up that specific protein.

NOTE: Proteins are amphoteric as they possess both basic and acidic amino acids.

## Nucleic acids
 Nucleic acids are loaded at the the cathode and move towards the anode,  
### Charge
Nucleic acids are always negatively charged due do their phosphate backbone.

## RNA

### Process

#### Buffer
RNA is heated in dilute formamide or glyoxal(which form part of the buffer solution) to prevent formation of secondary structures. Therefore RNA electrophoresis is said to use denaturing gels.

#### Quality
RNA qualtiy can be determined by the relative intensity of the 18s rRNA and 28s rRNA bands. In a pure sample the ration is expected to be, 28:18 $\equiv$ 2:1.

NOTE: 28s rRNA comes from the cells main ribosomes. 18s rRNA comes from mitochondirial, or choroplastic(?) ribosomes.



## Temperature

### Polymerization

#### Exothermic reaction
#### Gel irregularities
Pore sizes may differ.

### Electrophoresis

#### Denaturation of proteins
Denatured proteins can also lead to the smile effect.

#### Change in buffer.
Some buffers will change their pH based on the temperature, which leads changes in protein charge and moviment.

## Pulse field gel electrophoresis (PGFE)

### Process
PGFE used two or more alternating electric fields. Larger molecules will take longer to reorrientate than smaller molecules hence separation is on the basis if size.

### Function
PGFE is used to separate large DNA fragemtns up to 12Mb.

## Function

### Nucleic acid Separation
### Analysis of protein purity
### Separation of DNA and RNA.
### Determination of the isolelectric point. (Proteins)
### Estimation of native size (Proteins)



NOTE: $\text{Dalton}=g.mol^{-1}$
