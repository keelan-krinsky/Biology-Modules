# Electron Transport Chain

every pair of electrons which comes from the citric acid cycle will, combine with an oxygen to form a water molecule picking $H^+$ in the process. 

## Organisation
Sugars fats and amino acids are oxidised, and the energy released used to reduce coenzymes. The energy from the reduced coenzymes is used to set up a proton gradient across the membrane, both protons and electrons are removed from the coenzymes in this process. Electrons more from NADH and [FADH_2]$ to $O_2$

> NOTE: Electrons move from lower to higher oxidation potential. 

## Location 
across the mitochondrial inner membrane

## Molecular species involved
All are associated with proteins and with the membrane except for cytochrome C 

### Flavoproteins
Tightly bound FMN and FAD, can transfer one or two electrons. 

### Coenzyme Q/ ubiquinone
Can transfer one or two electrons forming quinones or semiquinones. 

### Cytochromes
Haem group, redox between $Fe^{2+}$ and $Fe^{3+}$. Hence cytochromes can only transfer one electron. 

#### Types 
names relating to their absorbance. 

##### a
Contains isochranoid group by which it is attached to the protein, and the A group can bind oxygen, hence cytochrome a comes directly before oxygen in the ETC

###### Cytochrome a3

##### Cytochrome b

##### Cytochrome c

###### Cytochrome c1

## Mitochondrial proteins
large multi subunit complexes within the mitochondrial membrane,




### Coenzyme Q
small yellow hydrophobic complex, buried inside the membrane. Hydrophobic isoprenoid tail allows it to diffuse freely within the hydrophobic core pf the inner mitochondrial membrane. Fully oxidised CoQ (ubiquinone UQ) to Semiquinone free radical intermediate UQ to fully reduced coenzyme Q ubiquinol $UQH_2$

### Complex 1
Electrons are transferred from $NADH$ to CoQ. Simultaneous protons are transferred from the (negative)matrix side of the protein to the positive/P/cytosolic side of the inner mitochondrial matrix. Very large protein with 46 polypeptide chains. Contains one molecules of FMN and 8-9 Fe-S clusters (20-26 Fe atoms). As each NADH contains two electrons must first transfer to the FMN in the complex to form $FAMH_2$, which can then release one electron at a time to the iron sulfur clusters. 

The overall transport within the complex is: $NADH \rightarrow FMN \rightarrow FMN \rightarrow Fe-S\rightarrow CoQ$

Energy from electron transfer releases protons which bind to complex I on the matrix side.Conformational changes accompanying electron transfer allow bound protons to cross the membrane. (The conformational change is related to the movement of a long helical complex which allows protons to escape (the exact number of $h^+$ which escape per electron is not confirmed but it is though to be 4H^+ for each two electrons. ))

#### Structure 
Hydrophobic domain inside membrane and hydrophilic domain inside matrix. 

## Complex 2 Succinate-coenzyme q reductase.
Accepts electrons from Succinate to reduce CoQ ($UQH_2$) (Succinate dehydrogenase). Complex I is a Flavoproteins as it is bound to FAN and an iron sulphur complex as it contains Fe-S cluster.

### Electron flow 
$Succinate\rightarrow$

No protons are transported across the membrane due to the relatively small free energy change of reduction. 

Contains ubiquinone binding site, 


## Complex 3 Coenzyme UQ-cytochrome c oxidoreductase. 
Complex III mediates electron transport from CoQ to Cytc. Accepts electrons from $UQH_2$ to Cytochrome c. The complex contains three different Chromes/heame groups, and one Iron sulfur protein. 

### Q cycle 

#### Process
The $Q_p$ site on the cytosolic side binds $UQH_2$ and releases UQ. The $Q_n$ site on the matrix side of the complex binds UQ and releases $UQH_2$. 

##### First Half
$UQH_2$ binds to the $Q_p$ site, and is oxidised in a two step process. 

###### Step One 
$UQH_2$ enters the $Q_p$ site of the enzyme complex and a electron is transferred from $UQH_2$ to iron Fe-S leaving a $UQ^-$ ion. The two hydrogen exit the complex into the intermembrane space as $H^+$ ions. From the Fe-S cluster the electron is transferred to on to Cytochrome C1 and then to cytochrome C, attached to the outside of the complex.

###### Step Two
An electron is transferred from $UQ^-$ to Cytochrome $b_L$, to produce UQ, which is released back into the pool within the membrane. From Cytochrome $b_L$ the electron is transferred to cytochrome $b_H$ and then to UQ to form $UQ^-$ in the $Q_n$ site of enzyme complex. 


##### Second Half

###### Step One

A second $UQH_2$ molecule enters the $Q_p$ site of the enzyme complex and again is oxidized to $UQ^-$. The electron is transferred to Fe-S, and then on through Cytochrome c1 to cytochrome C on the cytoplasmic side of the complex. The two hydrogen exit the complex on the cytoplasmic side, as $H^+$ ions.

###### Step Two
$UQ^-$ is oxidised to UQ, which exits the complex to reenter the UQ pool within the membrane. The electron is transferred to Cytochrome $b_L$, and from there on to Cytochrome $b_H$ and then to UQ^- within the $Q_n$ site (formed during the first half of the cycle). Two $H^+$ ions are also accepted by $UQ^-$ and $UQH^2$ is formed. 


##### Net reaction 

$UQH_2 +2H_\text{(matrix)}\rightarrow UQ^-+ 2Cyt c_{\text{reduced}} + 4H^+_\text{(cytoplasmic)}$

#### Proton transfer
The Q cycle is coupled with proton transfer across the inner mitochondrial membrane. 

## Complex 4 Cytochrome c oxidase. 
Takes electrons from cytochrome c and transfers them to the final electron acceptor, which is oxygen. 

The complex contains two different cytochromes, and three copper ions, it accepts electrons from cytochrome c and directs them to oxygen to form water. 

### Reduction equation 
$4Cytc(fe^{2^+})+4 Cytc (Fe^{3+})+2H_2O$

### Proton transfer
4 protons are transferred across the inner mitochondrial membrane. 

The net flow of electrons is from more negative to more positive, (although this is not a simple linear flow.)

## Protons channels 
Proton channels are inner membrane proteins which pump protons across the membrane via a proton jump. To power the proton movement a series of redox reactions take place within the protein. First 2 electrons are transferred from two cytochrome c molecules to Cu_A, from here the electrons are transferred to cytochrome A, and then to $Cu_B$ or cytochrome $a_3$ and from here they are transferred to oxygen the final electron acceptor. This process fuels the transfer of two membrane across the membrane to the cytoplasmic side. 

## Electron transport pathways
Water soluble cytochrome c carries electrons to complex IV. $UQH_2$ collects electrons from complex I and II and delivers them to complex III. 

## Mitchell Hypothesis. 
The Mitchell hypothesis states that energy from electron transfer is stored in the proton gradient formed as protons are driven across the mitochondrial inner membrane. The transfer of protons results in the formation of both an electrochemical and pH gradient (higher pH inside the matrix).
