# Solutions

### electrolytic solutions
Ionic dissociation occurs when the addition of a solvent or energy in the form
of heat causes molecules if crystals of a substance to break down into ions.

### Osmotic effects.
spontaneous net movement of solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane

### tonicity

#### hypotonic
lower ions concentration, high solvent concentration lower osmotic pressure

#### hypertonic
higher ion concentration, higher solute concentration, lower solvent
concentration, higher osmotic pressure

#### isotonic
equal osmotic pressure. and solute/solvent concentrations.

### Ideal Solutions
an ideal solution is a solution which has a enthalpy of solution equal to zero
NOTE: bonds forming releases heat energy.
FR: the concentration of water in a typical cell is 55molar.

### concentration measurements

#### molar/molarity/molar concentration
concentration of solute in a solution in terms of moles of solute per volume of
solution

#### molality
concentration of solute in a solution in terms of moles of solute per mass of
solvent.

#### Other measures.
%w/w weight of solute per weight of (solvent?)

%w/v weight per volume.

%v/v volume per volume.

#### osmolarity
concentration of solute as total number of solute particles per litre (?)

#### osmolality
Concentration of solute as total number of solute particles per kilogram.

#### osmol
number of solute particles which contribute towards the osmolarity of the
substance.
