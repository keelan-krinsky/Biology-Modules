# Glycolysis
Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway involving the stepwise degradation of glucose

> NOTE: All ATP formation which occurs in glycolosis is produced via subsrate level phosphorylation. 

## Background
Glycolysis is a very ancient process, which arose relatively early on in evolutionary history. As a result of its age, today almost all living organisms undergo some form of glycolysis. Glycolysis is an anaerobic process, as it arose before oxygen formed a large substituent of the earths atmosphere. Even in aerobic organism glycolysis still remains anaerobic, although the products of glycolysis are then fed into other aerobic pathways. 

## Process
Glycolysis involves the break down of glucose molecule into pyruvate through ten enzyme catalysed steps. These ten steps can be generally grouped into two phases, the initially priming phase in which glucose is transformed into a less stable form, a process which requires energy provided by coupling with ATP hydrolysis, and the second energy release phase in which new ATP is generated. For each one molecule of glucose metabolised, two molecules of pyruvate are produced. The balanced equation for the overall reaction is as follows: \newline 
$\text{Glucose}+2Pi+4NAD^++2ADP \rightarrow 4NADN+2H_2O+2ATP+4H^++2\text{Acetyl}-CoA+2CO_2+2CoASH$

### Phase #1 (Priming) 
Phase one includes the first 5 reactions of glycolysis, in which, overall, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is produced by the splitting of glucose. The balanced equation for this phase is as follows: \newline 

$\text{Glucose}+2ATP\rightarrow 2ADP+2Pi$

.

#### Energy requirements
2 ATP molecules are used up in this phase. 

#### Reaction #1
Glucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase or glucokinase to form glucose-6-phosphate, The reaction is coupled with the hydrolysis of one ATP molecule. The balanced equation for this reaction is as follows: 

$\text{Glucose} + mol^{-1}$
\newline

The phosphorylation of glocuse also assist in glucose take up by the cell, as glucose in the extrallcelar fluid diffused in to replace the glucose used up in the cytoplasm. Once the glucose has been phosphorylated it cannot easily cross the memebrane and so little it lost.

> NOTE: Extracellular glucose will move into the cell as glucose is converted from glucose to glucose 6 phosphate, by the law of mass action. 

> NOTE: Reaction one is often referred to as the first priming reaction. 

##### Enzymes
The reaction can be catalysed by glucokinase, or hexokinase. Both glucokinase and hexokinase require magnesium ions to function.  Glucokinase only functions at high glucose levels whereas hexokinase binds glucose at low glucose concentrations, hence glucokinase is only active after consumption of a high glucose meal. 

##### Regulation. 
Hexokinase is one of the regulated enzymes in glycolysis, the reaction is targeted as a regulation point due to its large negative free energy change. 

##### Energetics
The reaction itself is not thermodynamically favorable, and hence must be coupled with ATP hydrolysis to achieve spontaneity. 

#### Reaction #2
Glucose-6 Phosphate is converted into fructose 6 phosphate by phosphoglucoisomerase. The ballanced equation for the reaction is as follows. 

$\text{Glucose-6-phosphate}\rightarrow \text{Fructose-6-phosphate}\quad \quad \quad \quad \Delta G ^{\circ\prime}= 1.67 kJ \cdot mol^{-1}$
\newline\newline

##### Enzyme 
Phosphoglucoisomerase catalyses the reaction. This enzyme requires magnesium ions to function.

#### Reaction #3
Fructose-6-phosphate is phosphorylated into fructose-1,6-bisphosphate by  phosphofructokinase. The reaction is natively endothermic so must coupled with ATP Hydrolysis to occur. The balanced reaction is given as:\newline

$\text{Fructose-6-phosphate}+ATP\rightarrow \text{fructose-1,6,-bisphosphate}+ ATP$ $\quad\quad \Delta G^{\circ}\prime =-14.2kJ\cdot mol^{-1}$

\newline



> NOTE: Reaction 3 is often referred to as the second primary reaction.  

##### Enzyme 
The reaction is catalysed by phosphofructokinase.

##### Regulation
The phosphofructokinase reaction controls the rate of glycolysis. 
Intermediates of the citric acid cycle form allosteric inhibitor's which act on phosphofructokinase. More specifically phosphofructokinase is inhibited by Phosphenolpyruvate ,citrate and ATP. Additionally low PH also has an inhibitory effect.
\newline \newline

![Phospofructokinase ATP allosteric inhibition](GlycolysisPics/GR3R.jpg){width=40%}
\newline\newline
Phosphofructokinase is activated by Fructose 2-6 bisphosphate, which decreases the inhibitory effect of ATP adn inhibits fructose 1,6 bisphosphatase. Fructose 2-6 bisphosphate is produced from fructose 6 phosphate so high levels of fructose 6 phosphate lead to faster fructose 6 phosphate metabolism

#### Reaction #4
Fructose 1,6 biphosphate is cleaved by Fructose disphosphate aldolase to form Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), and Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP).The ballanced equation for the reaction is: \newline 

$F-1,6-BF\rightarrow DHAP+GAP \quad \quad\quad\quad\Delta G^{\circ\prime}=23.9kJ\cdot mol^{-1}$
\newline\newline

##### Enzyme

##### Reaction Mechanism
The DHAP is deprotonated by $Glu^{165}$ leading to the formation of an enediol intermediate this intermediate is then reprotonated and converted to glyceraldehyde, with the Glu molecule leaving as an oxianion. \newline\newline

The molecule is much less stable in its enol form so although it has gained only a small amount of energy,it still constitutes the much higher energy molecule. 

>NOTE: Enols tautomerise naturally to ketones.

## Location  
Glycolysis takes place within the cytoplasm.

## Biological significance
Glycolysis is a particularly important process as in many cases glucose is the only source of metabolic energy. Cells of the brain kidney contractual skeletal muscles, erythrocytes, and sperm cell, are all solely reliant on glycolysis for energy. 

## Products
Pyruvate is a versatile metabolite, which can be fed into a number of different additional catabolic pathways.
