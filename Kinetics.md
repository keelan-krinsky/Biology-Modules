## Reaction rate
the reaction rate is defined in terms of change in concentration of the reactants or products per unit time. Often the instantaneous reaction rate is considered. 
For example in the reaction $aA+bB\rightarrow cC+dD$ the rate of formation A is given by:\newline 
$v=\frac{\Delta A}{\Delta t}$\newline 

The instantaneous rate of the formation of A is given by:\newline
$\frac{dA}{dt}$

The rate of product formation can be directly equated to the rate of reactant disappearance, using the ratios present in the balanced equation for the reaction. For example: \nelwine

$\frac{dA}{adt}=-$\frac{dB}{abt}=\frac{dC}{cdt}=\frac{dD}{ddt}
