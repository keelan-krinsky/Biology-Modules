# Link Reaction
The link reaction involves the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate. 

## Equation 
$\text{Pyruvate}+ CoA + NAD^+ \rightarrow \text{Acetyl-CoA} + CO_2 +NADH+H^+$

### Catalyst 
The link reaction is catalysed by the enzyme dehydrogenase complex (PDC). The enzyme dehydrogenase complex is made up of three enzymes, complmade up of a number of three enzymes. Enzyme complexes improve effeciency as intermdiates will not diffuse away from the enzymes slowing down the rate. 

Pyruvate dehydraogenase 
Dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase 
and enzyme 3 (COPY Slide). 

#### Co enzymes 
the complex consists of five coenzymes 

##### CoASH

##### NAD^+

##### FAD

##### Lipoic acid 

##### Thiamine pyrophosphate


### Step 1 decarboxylation of pyruvate 
carbon dioxide is released, catalysed by enzyme 1


### Step 2
from thiamine pyrophosphate transfered to lipoic acid, catalysed by enzyme 2, (E2). 

### Step 3
lipoic acid to coA Enzyme 2, coversion to acetyl coA occurs at this point. 

#### Step 4 re-oxidation of glycoic acid, 
catalysed by E3
oxidation, and reduction of $NAD^+$

contains D-Robitol substituent, (which is not a try ribose sugar as it lacks a glycosidic bond) so tyechincally not a dincleutide, Isoalloxazine. 


Reduction occurs across the N+C bonds in the isoalloxazine substituent to from $FADH_2$ through the addition of a $H^-$ and a $H^+$

reduction invovling only $H^+$ leads to the formation of a radical on the carbon of the C-N bond, and the resuling amine group has a $pKa$ of 8.4
occurs vai the addition of $H^+$ and an electron.

$FAD$ differs from NAD in that it takes two hydrogens, (provided pH is below 8.4) becuase of these alternative reduction froms FAD can take on 1 or tewo electrons which allows for more versitility in the transfer of electrons. 

FAD/quinone is the fully oxidised form of FAD. 

hydride transfer leads to the full reduced from, the reduced form is not resonancce stabalised, so is not stable, and is the high energy form, will release energy when it undergoes oxidation. 

the partially oxidised semiquinone, blue and obsorbes at 570nm. contains one electron and 1H attatched. under special conditions when the pH is greater than the pKA it remains ionised red color semiquinone anion 490 nm
