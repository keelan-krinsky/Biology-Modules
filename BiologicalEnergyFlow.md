# Biological Energy Flow
The sun is the primary source of energy in almost all biological systems, and on a global scale the vast majority of energy supplied to the Biosphere is from the sun. 

## Energy flow through organisms

## Phototrophic organism types 
Phototrophic organisms use (sun) light as their energy sources, fixing/storing this energy in the form of various organic molecules.

## Metabolic energy flow 
Energy in a series of controlled exergonic/spontaneous reactions which drive other endergonic/non-spontaneous reactions. This energy flow between exergonic and endergonic reactions is achieved through the process of coupling, mediated by a small number of (high energy) biomolecules. High energy molecules react spontaneously with a substance in the environment such as oxygen or water. Reduced co-enzymes such as $NADH, NADPH, FADH_2$, react with oxygen and phosphate compounds such as ATP or thioesters such as acetyl coA react with water. Such reactions have high $\Delta G ^\circ '$ values, releasing large amounts of energy.
