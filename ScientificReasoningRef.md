# Scientific Reasoning

## Basic structures of an argument

### Premises
A Premise is a statment. This statement may be true or false.

In science the orginial premise is known as the hypothesis.
this hypothesis will be tested, usually impirically.

### Conclusions
A conclusion should be well supported by all premises. The conclusion leads one to decide if the hypothesis is true fo false.


## A good argument
A good argument can be deductively, or nondecuctive but abductively, or inductively strong.

NOTE: Arguments can be invalid even if all of the premises and the conclusion are true. If they do not actually imply eachother then it is simply a collection of facts and not an argument.  

### Deductive arguments
$A \in B \wedge B \in C \rightarrow C \in B$

#### Conditional
$\exists P \rightarrow \exists Q$

#### Contrapositive
$\nexists P \rightarrow \nexists Q$

#### Converse
$\exists Q \rightarrow \, \exists P$

#### deductive validity
1. Are the premices true (this is difficult if not impossible to establish in mathematics. )
2. Do the premices guarentee the truth on the conclusion.
3. does the argument beg the question (Not really one of the criteria)

### Non deductive arguments
most of science is actually non deductive reasoning. science will often venture conclusions beyond the scope of observation (induction).

#### Inductive Reasoning
In Inductive reasoning premises are veiw as strong support of the truth of the conclusion. however they do not garuntee the truth of the conclusion. Induction allows for conclusions to be made about issues outside the scope of ovservation.

##### Inductive strength
two factor influence the inductive strength of an argument, sample size and bias.

### Deductive arguments
### Abduction
abductive arguments seek to explain what is observed, otherwise known as inference to best explination.

#### Abductive arguments
abductive hypothesies should be able to predict easily testable results, such that if the predicted result is achieved during experimentation then the validity of the hypothesis is supported, and if it is not the hypothesis can be rejected.

(Abductive arguments usually rely on a number of assumptions which can be supported by the predictive power of the argument)

NOTE: if testing two alternative theories H1 and H0 then a good test experiment will be set up such that the the observation of event P supports H0 and negates H1 and visa versa.

#### Evaluating Abductive Inferences.

##### Surprise principles
If an observation supports a hypothesis, then it must strongly favour that hypothesis over others with which it competes

In order to satisfy this principle:
1. the hypothesis should make no fasle predictions
2. Within the set of true predictions which the hypothesis makes, there should be predictions which are expected NOT to come true if the hypothesis is false (Is this not mixed up somewhere?)

##### Abductive fallacy
A widely used and accepted expination is not necessary at all plausible, (even if no competing explination exists)


### Making observations

obervations can be made by human senses as well as by sophisticated scientific equipment.


#### examples

##### Medelian genetics.
mendal made conclusions very far beyond his premises, abducting from color change to the existance and role of gentic elements.

## A bad argument

### Circular arguments.
$A \in B \rightarrow A \in B$
