# Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle
In the citric acid cycle the CoA produced from the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate is further oxidised coenzymes $NADH$ and $FADH_2$ are reduced in the process. The Citric Acid cycle is significant in that it provides a chemically feasible way to cleave C-C bonds. In biological systems C-C bond cleavage can only be achieved between the alpha and beta carbon, or the carbonyl carbon and the alpha carbon when the alpha carbon contains an alcohol group. The Net reaction for the overall process is as follows:\newline

$Acetyl-CoA +3NAD^+ +FADH_2 +2H_2O+GDP+Pi \rightarrow CoA-SH+3NADH + FADH_2+GTP+ 2CO_2$ $\Delta G^\circ '=-40.1kJ\cdot mol^{-1}$

### ATP production
One ATP molecule is generated in the citric acid cycle. In animals this ATP is not generated directly rather a GTP molecule is generated which is hydrolyses to fuel ATP production. In bacterial cells ATP is generated directly. 

### Electrons Transfer 
8 high energy electrons are removed for each cycle in each cycle of the citric acid cycle. 

### Coenzymes reduced
For each cycle of the citric acid cycle 3 $NAD^+$ ions, and 1 $FAD$ molecule are reduced.

## Entry Point  
Acetyl-coA is the entry point of the citric acid cycle. 

### Source
Acetly-CoA comes from both glycolysis, and $\Beta$ oxidation of fats.

#### Glycolysis 
Pyruvate molecules are converted into Acetyl-CoA

#### $\Beta$ oxidation
$\Beta$ oxidation of fats produces acetyl-CoA

## Location 
 The Citric acid cycle takes place in the Mitochondrial matrix, with the exception of one reaction which is catalysed by a mitochondrial membrane protein. 

## Process

### Reaction 1 
The Acetyl group is condensed with Oxaloacetate by Citrate synthetase to form citrate.

#### Mechanism
$\text{Acetyl-CoA} + \text{Oxaloacetate} + H_2O \rightarrow CoASH + \text{Citrate}$ $\DeltaG^\circ '=-31kJ\cdot mol^{-1}$ 

##### Step #1
In the first step the acetyl group is condensed onto Oxaloacetate

##### Step #2
In the second step, the thioester bond between CoA and the acetyl group is hydrolyses, releasing CoA.

#### Energetic considerations
 The hydrolysis of the thioester bond releases a large amount of free energy and drives the overall reaction. The equilibrium constant for the condensation reaction is very close to one, so it does little to influence the spontaneity of the overall reaction.

#### Catalyst
This reaction is catalysed by citrate synthase

##### Inhibitors 
NADH and succinyl-CoA act as (allosteric inhibitors). 

#### Regulation 
The reaction is regulated through enzyme inhibition. 

### Reaction #2
citrate is isomerised to isocitrate by aconitase.

$\text{Citrate}\rightarrow \text{Isocitrate}$

The importance of this reaction in that it converts the tertiary alcohol citrate which cannot be (easily) oxidised into the secondary alcohol isocitrate which can. 

#### Mechanism

##### Step 1 
water is removed to from citrate to from cis-aconitate

##### Step 2 
Water is added to cis-aconitate to form isocitrate. This reaction is very sterio-specific, the pro-R hydrogen of the pro-R arm is removed. 

#### Catalysis 
This reaction is catalysed by aconitase. Aconitase contains Fe-S clusters within its structure.n the inactive from of the enzyme there are 3 iron atoms and 4 sulfur atoms, the present of a forth ion atom/ion activates the enzyme. During the reaction the $Fe^{3+}$ ion in the vacant position coordinates both the carboxyl and the OH group of citrate. Once coordinated to the $Fe^{3+}$ ion the OH group becomes a better leaving group, and is more easily removed from the citrate.

>NOTE: In iron sulfur clusters within proteins the sulfur derives from cysteine residues, and the iron/iron ions constitute a prosthetic group. 

### Reaction #3 
Isocitrate is oxidatively decarboxylated to $\alpha$ ketoglutarate first by dehydrogenation by isocitrate dehydrogenase and then by uncatalysed, spontaneous decarboxylation. 

$\text{Isocitrate}+NAD^+\rightarrow \alpha - \text{Ketoglutarate}+CO_2+NADH+H^+$

#### Mechanism
 
##### Step #1
Isocitrate is oxidised by $NAD^+$, two hydrogen atoms with their electrons are removed. The redox reaction is catalysed by isocitrate dehydrogenase, and the highly unstable oxalosuccinate intermediate is formed

##### Step #2
The oxalosuccinate intermediate rapidly decarboxylates to form $\alpha$-Ketoglutarate. 

#### Coenzymes
One molecule of $NAD^+$ is reduced.

#### Catalyst
Isocitrate dehydrogenase

##### Regulation

###### Inhibition
ATP and NADH allosterically inhibit isocitrate dehydrogenase

###### Activation
ADP allosterically activates isocitrate dehydrogenase.

## Reaction #4
$\alpha$ ketoglutarate is oxidatively decarboxylated by $\alpha$ ketoglutarate dehydrogenase condensing with CoASH in the process to form Succinyl-CoA. The Succinyl-CoA formed is a high energy bond to due the thioester C-S bonds which it contains.

$\alpha \text{Ketoglutarate} +NAD^+CoASH \rightarrow \text{Succinyl-CoA}+NADH+H^+$ Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. 

#### Mechanism
Oxidation and decarboxylation occur in a single step as the reaction is catalysed by a multienzyme complex. 

> NOTE: two energy rich products, a thioester and reduced coenzyme are produced by this reaction.

> NOTE: the hydrogen lost in this case come from the coenzyme. 

#### Catalyst 
The reaction is catalysed by a multienzyme complex including $\alpha$-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. 


## Reaction #5 
substrate level phosphorylation, succinyl-CoA $\rightarrow$ Succinate
succinyl-CoA synthase

nucleotide dehydrogenase kinase used GTP formed to make ATP.

GTPis formed in this reactionandthen ATP is produced in turn by nucleoside diphosphate kinase. 

## Reaction #6
Succinate oxidased to fumerate in an FAD-dependant reaction 
succinate dehydrogenase. $FADH_2$ is formed. 

REmoval of H occurs across the H-H single bond to form the double bond in fumerate. trans fumerate is formed.as there is less energy produced in this reaction FAD is produced instead of NAD,reduced [FAD] square brackets indicate covalent atatchment. the proS hydrogen is removed from the one carbon and the proR hydrogen is removed from the other. FAD goes to the Fe-S clusters and from there to co-Q in the ETC. 


## Reaction #7
trans hhydratopmpf fumerate $\rightarrow$ L-malate
fumarate
 
 water is added across the double bond of fumerate to form malate. 
## Reaction 8  
malate oxidised back to oxeloacetate. 
malate dehydrogenase

NADH us produced this is the foruth coenzyme reduced via the oxidation of the single acetate unit.

as two carbons enter the cycel and two carbons leave the cycle the amount of energy remains constant, 

metabolic energy is captured in the form of reduced coenzymes. 

the reaction is highly endergonic, so the concentration of oxaloacetate will be very low. 

## energetic considerations
 $CH_3COO^_\rightarrow 2CO_2$. 

the cycle is centered around C-C cleavage, essentially, In biological systems, a carbon carbon bond can be cleaved between the Alpha and beta carbon, or if the alpha carbon is attatched to an OH group, then the bond between the Carboxyl carbon and the alpha carbon can be cleaved. 
in the cytric acid cycle the condensation of the acetate with oxaloacetate alows for beta cleavage.

## Thermodynamics
Citrate synthase, Isocitrate dehydrogenase and $\alpha$ Ketoglutarate, all catalyse very exergonic reaction and are sites of regulation. 

Malate cleavage in the last step is highly endergonic. 


There is one enzyme which is not soluble, it is found in the membrane, pulled forward by step one in which oxaloacetate is removed. 

The citric acid cycle is catabolic in terms of the substrate, but the intermediates are starting points for many other biological molecules, so in that sense is also anabolic. Anaplerotic reactions feed intermediates directly back into the cycle. 

## Regulation
The Citric acid cycle is the link between pyruvate and the electron transport chain. If too much energy is being produced then resources are being wasted. Reaction pyruvate dehydrogenase up regulated by NAD^+ and CoA, down regulated by Acetyl-CoA NADH and ATP
1(citrate synthase  is down regulated by ATP NADH and Succinyl CoA)) 3(isocitrate dehydrogenase Citrate synthase and 4($\alpha$ Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, up regulated by AMP down regulated by NADH Succinyl-CoA) are regulated. 
Succinyl-CoA is an intra cycle regulator.  Acetyl CoA can speed up or slow down the cycle. 

NADH inhibits all four enzymes shutting down the cycle. 

## Reduction potentials. 
quantifies the tendency of chemical species to be reduced or oxidised. 
When the donor becomes oxidised the acceptor will become reduced. The donor looses its electrons the acceptor gains electrons. The standard reduction  potential can be related to the free energy by the equation. 

$\DeltaG^\cric ' =-nF\Delta E_0$
where $E_0$ is the difference in potentials. The reduction potential oxidised and reduced versions of the substance whose reduction potential is being measured.the standard H cell is set to zero, a volt meter is a meter. Reduction occurs at the negative half cell, and oxidation at the positive electrode. Standard reduction potentials can be used. 
the more positive the greater the tendency to accept electrons, i.e. undergo reduction, negative implies tendency to loose electron oxidation occurs.
